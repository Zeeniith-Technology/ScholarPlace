# ⏰ **MONDAY: PROFIT & LOSS FUNDAMENTALS - DAY 1 (10K WORDS)**

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY PROFIT & LOSS FUNDAMENTALS - PART 1 WEEK 5 BRIDGE & FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS

**Week 5 Mastery Review - Rate-Based Thinking Foundation:**

You completed Week 5 with deep understanding of rates across domains:

**Week 5 Core Concepts (Your Foundation):**
- TSD: Speed = Distance/Time (rate = output/input)
- Trains: Relative speed (add/subtract based on direction)
- Boats: Upstream (b-c), Downstream (b+c) (rate modification with constraints)
- Alligation: Weighted averages for mixing (proportion relationships)
- Integration: Multi-system optimization

**Critical Week 5 Example (Your Bridge):**

Q: Boat 18 km/hr still water, current 2 km/hr. Downstream 20 km/hr, upstream 16 km/hr.
- Boat speed = (20+16)/2 = **18 km/hr** ✓
- Current = (20-16)/2 = **2 km/hr** ✓

**Why this matters for Week 6:**
- Week 5 taught: Speed = relationship between distance and time
- Week 6 teaches: **Profit% = relationship between gain and cost**
- **IDENTICAL MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE**

---

**Week 6 Mission - PROFIT/LOSS AS RATES:**

Profit/Loss is **identical to Week 5 rates**, but financial context:

| Concept | Week 5 (TSD/Boats) | **Week 6 (P&L)** |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Rate Definition** | Speed = Distance/Time | **Profit% = (SP-CP)/CP × 100** |
| **Example Rate** | 60 km/hr | **20% profit** |
| **Combined Action** | Relative speed (add/subtract) | **Discount + Tax/Shipping** |
| **Formula** | D = S × T | **SP = CP × (1 + Profit%/100)** |
| **Finding "Time"** | T = D/S | **CP = SP / (1 + Profit%/100)** |
| **Ratio Property** | Speed ratio → Distance ratio | **Profit% ratio → Price ratio** |

**Key Insight:** Profit% = (Gain/Cost Price) × 100 is a **RATE** just like speed!
- Week 5: Speed = Distance/Time
- Week 6: Profit Rate = Gain/Cost Price
- **SAME MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURE**

**Learning Objectives (By Day 1 End):**
- [ ] Understand CP, SP, Profit, Loss as fundamental concepts
- [ ] Calculate Profit% and Loss% from CP/SP
- [ ] Find CP/SP given Profit% and other value
- [ ] Handle successive profit/loss scenarios
- [ ] Apply ratio concepts to P&L problems
- [ ] Verify using consistency checks
- [ ] Connect P&L to Week 5 rates framework

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY PROFIT & LOSS FUNDAMENTALS - PART 2 DEEP CONCEPT: PROFIT AS A RATE (WEEK 5 TRANSFER)

**Fundamental Definitions:**

| Term | Definition | Formula |
|------|------------|---------|
| **CP** | Cost Price | Amount merchant pays to acquire good |
| **SP** | Selling Price | Amount merchant receives when selling |
| **Profit** | SP > CP | SP - CP |
| **Loss** | SP < CP | CP - SP |
| **Profit %** | Profit relative to CP | **(SP-CP)/CP × 100%** |
| **Loss %** | Loss relative to CP | **(CP-SP)/CP × 100%** |

**Mathematical Identity (Week 5 Parallel):**

Profit% = (SP - CP) / CP × 100% = **(SP/CP - 1) × 100%**

This is **exactly** like:
- Week 5: Speed = Distance/Time
- Here: SP/CP = 1 + Profit%/100 (multiplicative rate!)

**Example:**
- CP = 100, SP = 120 → Profit = 20, Profit% = 20/100 × 100% = **20%**
- SP/CP = 120/100 = 1.2 = 1 + 20/100 ✓

---

**SP Formula:**
$$\text{SP} = \text{CP} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{Profit\%}}{100}\right)$$

**CP Formula:**
$$\text{CP} = \frac{\text{SP}}{1 + \frac{\text{Profit\%}}{100}}$$

**Loss Formula (Negative Profit):**
$$\text{SP} = \text{CP} \times \left(1 - \frac{\text{Loss\%}}{100}\right)$$

---

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY PROFIT & LOSS FUNDAMENTALS - PART 3 BASIC P&L WORKED EXAMPLES

**Ex 1.1: Finding Profit and Profit %**

Q: CP = 150, SP = 180. Find profit and profit%.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Profit**
- Profit = SP - CP = 180 - 150 = **30**

**Step 2: Profit %**
- Profit% = (30/150) × 100% = **20%**

**Verification:**
- SP = CP × (1 + 20/100) = 150 × 1.2 = 180 ✓

---

**Ex 1.2: Finding Loss and Loss %**

Q: CP = 200, SP = 160. Find loss and loss%.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Loss**
- Loss = CP - SP = 200 - 160 = **40**

**Step 2: Loss %**
- Loss% = (40/200) × 100% = **20%**

**Verification:**
- SP = CP × (1 - 20/100) = 200 × 0.8 = 160 ✓

---

**Ex 1.3: Finding CP Given SP and Profit %**

Q: SP = 300, Profit = 25%. Find CP.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Use formula**
- CP = SP / (1 + Profit%/100)
- CP = 300 / (1 + 25/100)
- CP = 300 / 1.25
- CP = **240**

**Step 2: Verify**
- SP = 240 × 1.25 = 300 ✓
- Profit = 300 - 240 = 60
- Profit% = 60/240 × 100% = 25% ✓

---

**Ex 1.4: Finding SP Given CP and Loss %**

Q: CP = 500, Loss = 15%. Find SP.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Use formula**
- SP = CP × (1 - Loss%/100)
- SP = 500 × (1 - 15/100)
- SP = 500 × 0.85
- SP = **425**

**Step 2: Verify**
- Loss = 500 - 425 = 75
- Loss% = 75/500 × 100% = 15% ✓

---

**Ex 1.5: Three-Article Problem (Ratio)**

Q: Articles A, B, C have CP ratio 2:3:4. Profit% on each is 20%, 15%, 10% respectively. Find total profit.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Assign values**
- CP_A = 2k, CP_B = 3k, CP_C = 4k
- Total CP = 9k

**Step 2: Calculate SP for each**
- SP_A = 2k × 1.20 = 2.4k
- SP_B = 3k × 1.15 = 3.45k
- SP_C = 4k × 1.10 = 4.4k
- Total SP = 10.25k

**Step 3: Total profit**
- Profit = 10.25k - 9k = 1.25k
- Profit% = (1.25k/9k) × 100% = **13.89%**

---

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY PROFIT & LOSS FUNDAMENTALS - PART 4 COMMON MISTAKES DAY 1

**Mistake 1: Calculating Profit % from SP Instead of CP**

❌ **Error:** "SP = 180, CP = 150. Profit% = (30/180) × 100 = 16.67%?"

✅ **Reality:** Profit% = (30/150) × 100 = **20%**

**Why:** Profit% is ALWAYS relative to CP (cost), not SP!

**Prevention:** "Profit% uses CP in denominator. Always!"

---

**Mistake 2: Adding/Subtracting Profit% Directly**

❌ **Error:** "10% profit, then 10% profit = 20% total?"

✅ **Reality:** It's multiplicative! (1.10 × 1.10 = 1.21 = 21% total)

**Prevention:** Use multiplication for successive changes: (1 + P₁/100) × (1 + P₂/100)

---

**Mistake 3: Confusing Loss% with Profit%**

❌ **Error:** "Loss = 50, CP = 200. Loss% = (50/50) × 100?"

✅ **Reality:** Loss% = (50/200) × 100 = 25% (always divide by CP)

**Prevention:** Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100, not (Loss/Loss)

---

**Mistake 4: Using SP as Base Instead of CP**

❌ **Error:** "After selling, if profit = SP - CP, then CP = SP - Profit?"

✅ **Reality:** CP = SP / (1 + Profit%/100) [division, not subtraction for %]

**Prevention:** When profit% is given, always divide SP by (1 + Profit%/100)

---

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY PROFIT & LOSS FUNDAMENTALS - PART 5 INTERVIEW TIPS DAY 1

**Tip 1: State All Components Clearly**

"CP = 200, SP = 240.
Profit = 240 - 200 = **40**
Profit% = (40/200) × 100 = **20%**"

Shows: Clarity, accuracy, understanding of fundamentals.

---

**Tip 2: Use Ratio Method for Quick Calculation**

"Items A, B have CP ratio 3:2. A sells at 20% profit, B at 10% profit.
CP_A = 3x, CP_B = 2x
SP_A = 3.6x, SP_B = 2.2x
Total SP = 5.8x, Total CP = 5x
Overall profit = 0.8x/5x = 16%"

Shows: Systematic thinking, ratio mastery.

---

**Tip 3: Verify Using the Reverse**

"If CP = 150 and profit = 20%, then SP should be:
SP = 150 × 1.20 = 180
Check: Profit% = (180-150)/150 × 100 = 20% ✓"

Shows: Verification habit, attention to detail.

---

**Tip 4: Connect to Week 5**

"Profit% works like speed ratios. If Speed ratio = 4:3, then distance ratio = 4:3 (time constant).
Similarly, if CP ratio = 3:2 and both have same profit%, then SP ratio = 3:2 (profit% constant)."

Shows: Deep understanding, ability to transfer concepts.

---

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY PROFIT & LOSS FUNDAMENTALS - PART 6 ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES DAY 1 EXTRA DEPTH

**Ex 1.6: When Does Loss% Equal Profit%?**

Q: What CP and SP relationship makes loss% numerically equal to profit%?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Set up equation**
- Let loss% = profit% = x
- For loss: Loss = CP × (x/100)
- For profit: Profit = CP × (x/100)

**Step 2: Conditions**
- Loss scenario: SP = CP - CP(x/100) = CP(1 - x/100)
- Profit scenario: SP = CP + CP(x/100) = CP(1 + x/100)

**Step 3: Insight**
- Loss% and profit% are numerically equal only in magnitude
- They represent different relationships:
  - Loss: percentage of original CP lost
  - Profit: percentage of original CP gained

---

**Ex 1.7: Profit% with Fractional CP**

Q: CP = 3/4 of SP. Find profit%.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Express relationship**
- CP = (3/4) × SP
- Therefore: SP = (4/3) × CP

**Step 2: Profit**
- Profit = SP - CP = (4/3)CP - CP = (1/3)CP

**Step 3: Profit %**
- Profit% = ((1/3)CP / CP) × 100% = (1/3) × 100% = **33.33%**

---

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY PROFIT & LOSS FUNDAMENTALS - PART 7 PRACTICE QUESTIONS DAY 1 WITH SOLUTIONS

**Q1.1: Basic Profit Calculation**

Q: CP = 80, SP = 100. Profit and profit%?

**Answer:**
- Profit = 100 - 80 = **20**
- Profit% = (20/80) × 100 = **25%**

**Q1.2: Basic Loss Calculation**

Q: CP = 250, SP = 200. Loss and loss%?

**Answer:**
- Loss = 250 - 200 = **50**
- Loss% = (50/250) × 100 = **20%**

**Q1.3: Finding CP from SP and Profit %**

Q: SP = 500, Profit = 25%. Find CP.

**Answer:**
- CP = 500 / 1.25 = **400**

**Q1.4: Finding SP from CP and Loss %**

Q: CP = 600, Loss = 10%. Find SP.

**Answer:**
- SP = 600 × 0.9 = **540**

**Q1.5: Three Items with Different Profits**

Q: CP A:B:C = 1:2:3. Profit% A:B:C = 10:15:20%. Total profit%?

**Answer:**
- CP_A = k, CP_B = 2k, CP_C = 3k, Total = 6k
- SP_A = 1.1k, SP_B = 2.3k, SP_C = 3.6k, Total = 7k
- Profit% = (1k/6k) × 100 = **16.67%**

**Q1.6: Loss on Part, Profit on Part**

Q: Sell item A at 20% loss, B at 30% profit. Both cost 100 each. Total profit/loss%?

**Answer:**
- SP_A = 80, SP_B = 130, Total SP = 210
- Total CP = 200
- Profit% = (10/200) × 100 = **5%**

**Q1.7: When Profit = Loss in Absolute Value**

Q: CP = 300. At what SP will absolute profit value = absolute loss value?

**Answer:**
- For same absolute value, SP must = CP (no profit, no loss)
- Otherwise, profit and loss magnitudes differ because they're percentages of same CP
- At CP = 300, if loss = 100, then loss% = 33.33%
- To have profit = 100, profit% = 33.33% also, so SP = 400

**Q1.8: Multiple Transactions Same Item**

Q: Buy at 100, sell at 10% profit (110), buy again at 110, sell at 20% profit. Total profit%?

**Answer:**
- First sale: SP = 110, profit = 10
- Second sale: SP = 110 × 1.2 = 132, profit on second = 22
- Total profit = 32, Total CP = 100 + 110 = 210
- Profit% = (32/210) × 100 = **15.24%**

**Q1.9: CP from Ratio and Profit**

Q: Two articles have SP ratio 5:7. Profit% each is 25%. Find CP ratio.

**Answer:**
- SP ratio = 5:7, so SP_A = 5k, SP_B = 7k
- CP_A = 5k/1.25 = 4k, CP_B = 7k/1.25 = 5.6k
- CP ratio = 4k : 5.6k = **5:7** (same as SP ratio when profit% equal!)

**Q1.10: Profit vs Cost Relationship**

Q: Profit = 1/4 of CP. Find profit%.

**Answer:**
- Profit = CP/4
- Profit% = (CP/4) / CP × 100% = (1/4) × 100% = **25%**

# ⏰ **TUESDAY: ADVANCED P&L - DISCOUNTS & MARKED PRICE - DAY 2 (12K WORDS)**

## TITLE DAY 2 TUESDAY ADVANCED P&L - PART 1 DAY 2 OBJECTIVE & NEW CONCEPTS

**Day 1 Mastery Recap:**
- CP (Cost Price), SP (Selling Price), Profit, Loss
- Profit% = (SP-CP)/CP × 100, Loss% = (CP-SP)/CP × 100
- SP = CP × (1 + Profit%/100), CP = SP / (1 + Profit%/100)
- Ratio applications in P&L

**Day 2 Mission - REAL-WORLD PRICING:**

In reality, merchants don't just decide SP directly. They use:
1. **Marked Price (MP):** List/displayed price to customers
2. **Discount:** Reduction from MP (given as % or amount)
3. **Selling Price:** SP = MP - Discount
4. Then calculate profit/loss from CP

**Critical Real-World Scenario:**
- Merchant marks item with 40% profit (MP = CP × 1.40)
- Offers 20% discount (SP = MP × 0.80)
- Net profit = (SP - CP)/CP × 100

**Learning Objectives (By Day 2 End):**
- [ ] Understand relationship MP → Discount → SP → Profit%
- [ ] Calculate SP from MP and discount
- [ ] Handle successive discounts (chain discounts)
- [ ] Find breakeven discount (where profit% = 0)
- [ ] Solve dishonest dealing problems (fake weights)
- [ ] Integrate discount, tax, and markup scenarios
- [ ] Apply alligation method to mixed discounts

---

## TITLE DAY 2 TUESDAY ADVANCED P&L - PART 2 DEEP CONCEPT: MARKED PRICE & DISCOUNT CHAIN

**Fundamental Relationship:**

| Term | Definition | Formula |
|------|------------|---------|
| **MP** | Marked Price | Displayed/list price |
| **Discount** | Reduction from MP | Discount% = (Discount/MP) × 100 |
| **SP** | Selling Price after discount | SP = MP × (1 - Discount%/100) |
| **Profit** | Gain from CP to SP | Profit = SP - CP |
| **Overall Profit%** | Final profit relative to CP | Profit% = (SP-CP)/CP × 100 |

---

**Successive/Chain Discounts (Key Insight!):**

When multiple discounts apply (like 20% then 10%):
- ❌ **WRONG:** Add discounts = 20% + 10% = 30%
- ✅ **RIGHT:** Multiply = (0.80 × 0.90) = 0.72 = 28% total

**Formula:**
$$\text{SP} = \text{MP} \times \left(1 - \frac{D_1}{100}\right) \times \left(1 - \frac{D_2}{100}\right) \times \ldots$$

**Example:**
- MP = 1000, Discount 1 = 20%, Discount 2 = 10%
- SP = 1000 × 0.80 × 0.90 = **720**
- Total discount = (280/1000) × 100 = 28%

---

## TITLE DAY 2 TUESDAY ADVANCED P&L - PART 3 MARKED PRICE & DISCOUNT WORKED EXAMPLES

**Ex 2.1: Basic Discount Calculation**

Q: MP = 500, Discount = 15%. Find SP.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate discount amount**
- Discount = 500 × 15/100 = 75

**Step 2: Find SP**
- SP = MP - Discount = 500 - 75 = **425**

OR: SP = 500 × (1 - 0.15) = 500 × 0.85 = **425**

---

**Ex 2.2: Markup then Discount**

Q: CP = 100. Mark at 50% profit. Offer 20% discount. Find final profit%.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Marked Price**
- MP = CP × 1.50 = 100 × 1.50 = **150**

**Step 2: Selling Price**
- SP = MP × 0.80 = 150 × 0.80 = **120**

**Step 3: Final Profit**
- Profit = 120 - 100 = 20
- Profit% = (20/100) × 100 = **20%**

**Insight:** 50% markup minus 20% discount ≠ 30% profit!
- (1.50 × 0.80) = 1.20 = 20% profit (multiplicative!)

---

**Ex 2.3: Successive Discounts**

Q: MP = 1000. Discounts 20%, then 10%, then 5%. Find SP and total discount%.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Apply discounts sequentially**
- After 20%: 1000 × 0.80 = 800
- After 10%: 800 × 0.90 = 720
- After 5%: 720 × 0.95 = **684**

**Step 2: Total discount**
- Discount = 1000 - 684 = 316
- Discount% = (316/1000) × 100 = **31.6%**

OR: (0.80 × 0.90 × 0.95) = 0.684 = 31.6% discount

---

**Ex 2.4: Finding MP Given SP and Discount**

Q: SP = 400, Discount = 25%. Find MP and profit% (if CP = 320).

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Find MP**
- SP = MP × (1 - 0.25)
- 400 = MP × 0.75
- MP = 400/0.75 = **533.33**

**Step 2: Profit%**
- Profit = 400 - 320 = 80
- Profit% = (80/320) × 100 = **25%**

---

**Ex 2.5: Alligation with Two Different Discount Items**

Q: 100 items at MP = 100. Some discounted 10%, others 20%. Mixed SP = 90 per item. How many of each?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Find SP for each group**
- Group A (10% discount): SP = 100 × 0.90 = **90**
- Group B (20% discount): SP = 100 × 0.80 = **80**
- Overall average: **90**

**Step 2: Alligation table**

| Group | SP | Difference from Mean |
|-------|-----|----------------------|
| A | 90 | 0 (at mean!) |
| B | 80 | -10 |
| Mean | 90 | 0 |

**Step 3: Since mean is 90 and A's SP is 90**
- All items must be Group A!
- **All 100 items at 10% discount**

(If average were 87, we'd use ratio: 7:3)

## TITLE DAY 2 TUESDAY ADVANCED P&L - PART 4 DISHONEST DEALING: FAKE WEIGHTS

**Concept - Merchant Uses False Weights:**

A dishonest merchant might:
- **Claim:** Selling 1 kg at price X
- **Reality:** Using 900g weight, actually giving only 900g
- **Profit:** Sells 900g but customer pays for 1000g!

**Formula for Profit% (Fake Weights):**

$$\text{Profit\%} = \frac{\text{Claimed Weight} - \text{Actual Weight}}{\text{Actual Weight}} \times 100\%$$

**Example:**
- Claims 1000g, gives 800g
- Profit% = ((1000-800)/800) × 100 = (200/800) × 100 = **25%**

---

**Ex 2.6: Dishonest Dealing - Buying Fake Weights**

Q: Merchant buys at 1000 per kg using 1000g weights (fair). Sells at 1000 per kg using 800g weights (fake). Profit%?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Cost for 1 kg (seller perspective)**
- Pays for 1000g at 1000/kg = **1000**
- Actually receives 1000g (bought fairly)

**Step 2: Revenue from 1 kg (seller perspective)**
- Claims to sell 1 kg at 1000/kg
- But gives only 800g

**Step 3: Profit calculation**
- Profit from 800g = 1000 - 800 = 200
- Cost of 800g = 800 (at 1/g)
- Profit% = (200/800) × 100 = **25%**

---

**Ex 2.7: Buying and Selling with Fake Weights**

Q: Merchant buys using 1200g weights (cheats on buying) at 100 per kg. Sells using 800g weights (cheats on selling) at 100 per kg. Profit%?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: What he pays for (claims 1200g, gives correct weight)**
- Actually pays for 1200g ÷ 1000 = 1.2 kg worth
- At 100/kg, pays 120 for what should be 1200g of goods

**Step 2: What he gets (receiving short)**
- Uses 1200g weight to measure, but gives only what he paid for
- Receives 1000g of actual goods (because his 1200g weight is heavy)

**Step 3: What he sells**
- Claims to sell 1kg using 800g weight
- 1 claim of "1kg" = 1000g claimed, but 800g weights, so he's giving less
- Actually delivers 800g for each "kg" claimed

**Step 4: Revised calculation (Per kg of actual goods)**
- Cost: 120 (paid for 1.2kg but got 1kg of goods) = 120 per kg
- Revenue: For 1kg of goods, using 800g weights, he makes 1000/800 = 1.25 claims of "1kg"
- Revenue: 1.25 × 100 = 125
- **Profit% = (125-120)/120 × 100 = 4.17%**

(Detailed dishonest scenarios often require careful tracking!)

## TITLE DAY 2 TUESDAY ADVANCED P&L - PART 5 COMMON MISTAKES DAY 2

**Mistake 1: Adding Discounts Instead of Multiplying**

❌ **Error:** "20% discount then 10% discount = 30% total discount"

✅ **Reality:** (1 - 0.20) × (1 - 0.10) = 0.80 × 0.90 = 0.72 = 28% total discount

**Prevention:** "Successive operations are multiplicative, not additive!"

---

**Mistake 2: Calculating Discount from SP Instead of MP**

❌ **Error:** "SP = 400, Discount = 25%. So MP = 400 + (400×0.25) = 500?"

✅ **Reality:** SP = MP × (1 - 0.25), so MP = 400/0.75 = **533.33**

**Prevention:** "Discount% always uses MP as base in denominator"

---

**Mistake 3: Confusion Between Markup and Discount**

❌ **Error:** "50% markup means 50% profit?"

✅ **Reality:** Only if there's no discount! With discount, final profit% changes.

**Prevention:** Markup → Discount → Final Profit% are three separate steps

---

**Mistake 4: Fake Weight Profit Calculation**

❌ **Error:** "1kg claimed, 800g given. Profit = (1000-800)/1000 = 20%?"

✅ **Reality:** Profit% = (1000-800)/800 = 25% (use actual weight in denominator)

**Prevention:** "Profit% uses ACTUAL quantity as denominator"

**Tip 1: State Markup and Discount Separately**

"CP = 200. Mark at 50% profit: MP = 200 × 1.5 = 300.
Offer 20% discount: SP = 300 × 0.8 = 240.
Profit% = (240-200)/200 × 100 = 20%"

Shows: Clear breakdown, systematic thinking.

---

**Tip 2: Use Ratio for Successive Discounts**

"Successive discounts 20%, 10%, 5%.
Combined = 0.80 × 0.90 × 0.95 = 0.684
Effective single discount = 31.6%"

Shows: Understanding of multiplicative chains.

---

**Tip 3: Apply Alligation to Discount Problems**

"Mix two items: one at 10% discount (MP=100, SP=90), another at 20% discount (MP=100, SP=80).
If average SP = 88:
Using alligation: (90-88):(88-80) = 2:8 = 1:4 ratio
So 1 part at 10%, 4 parts at 20%"

Shows: Week 1 alligation transfer.

---

**Tip 4: Connect Fake Weights to Actual Profit**

"Merchant claims 1kg at 100/kg but gives 800g using fake weights.
Revenue = 100 (claimed 1kg at 100/kg)
Cost = 80 (actual 800g at 100/kg for 1g)
Profit% = (100-80)/80 × 100 = 25%"

Shows: Deep understanding of hidden profit.

**Answer:**
- MP = 350 / 0.70 = **500**

**Q2.3: Markup and Discount Combined**

Q: CP = 250. Mark 40% up. Give 10% discount. Profit%?

**Answer:**
- MP = 250 × 1.40 = 350
- SP = 350 × 0.90 = 315
- Profit% = (315-250)/250 × 100 = **26%**

**Q2.4: Successive Discounts**

Q: MP = 2000. Discounts 15%, 10%, 5%. SP and effective discount%?

**Answer:**
- SP = 2000 × 0.85 × 0.90 × 0.95 = 1445.5 ≈ **1445**
- Effective discount% = (2000-1445)/2000 × 100 = **27.75%**

**Q2.5: Alligation - Two Discounts**

Q: 60 items at MP = 100. 40 items at 15% discount, 20 items at 25% discount. Average SP?

**Answer:**
- SP (15% disc) = 85
- SP (25% disc) = 75
- Average = (40×85 + 20×75)/60 = (3400+1500)/60 = **81.67**

**Q2.6: Dishonest Dealing**

Q: Merchant claims 1kg at 80/kg but gives 900g. Profit%?

**Answer:**
- Revenue per "kg" claimed = 80
- Cost per "kg" claimed = 900g at 80/kg = 72
- Profit% = (80-72)/72 × 100 = **11.11%**

**Q2.7: Double Dishonesty**

Q: Buys using 1100g weights (claims 1000g), sells using 900g weights. Both at same rate. Profit%?

**Answer:**
- When buying: claims 1000, gets 1100, pays for 1100 (corrected cost)
- When selling: claims 1000, gives 900, receives payment for 1000
- Per "kg" claimed: pays cost of 1100g, gets payment for 1000g
- Profit = 1000 - 1100 = -100... No, let me recalculate.
- Actually, when buying at same rate: costs same
- When selling at same rate, claims 1kg but gives 900g
- Profit% = (1000-900)/900 × 100 = **11.11%**

**Q2.8: Profit with Overhead Costs**

Q: CP = 100. MP = 150. Overhead = 10. Discount = 20%. Profit?

**Answer:**
- SP = 150 × 0.80 = 120
- Profit = SP - CP - Overhead = 120 - 100 - 10 = **10**
- Profit% = (10/110) × 100 = 9.09% (note: overhead affects denominator)

**Q2.9: Finding Discount for Target Profit**

Q: CP = 500. Mark at 100% profit (MP = 1000). What discount% to achieve 40% profit?

**Answer:**
- Target SP = 500 × 1.40 = 700
- Discount = 1000 - 700 = 300
- Discount% = (300/1000) × 100 = **30%**

**Q2.10: Successive Markup and Discount**

Q: CP = 100. Markup 50% (MP). Discount 20%. Then another 50% markup of NEW MP. Another 10% discount. Final profit%?

**Answer:**
- After 50% markup: MP₁ = 150
- After 20% discount: SP₁ = 150 × 0.80 = 120
- This becomes new CP for next transaction? Or still based on original CP = 100?
- Assuming separate: MP₂ = 150 × 1.50 = 225
- After 10% discount: SP₂ = 225 × 0.90 = 202.5
- If final profit based on original CP = 100: Profit% = (202.5-100)/100 × 100 = **102.5%**

**Q2.11: Break-Even Discount**

Q: CP = 400. Mark 50% (MP = 600). What discount% makes profit% = 0?

**Answer:**
- Break-even means SP = CP = 400
- Discount = 600 - 400 = 200
- Discount% = (200/600) × 100 = **33.33%**

**Q2.12: Multiple Item Discounts**

Q: 5 items at MP = 80 each, 3 items at MP = 120 each. All at 25% discount. Average SP?

**Answer:**
- Total MP = 5×80 + 3×120 = 400 + 360 = 760
- All discounted 25%: Total SP = 760 × 0.75 = **570**
- Average SP = 570/8 = **71.25**

**Q2.13: Discount Chain with Mixed Items**

Q: Two items: A at 500 with 20% discount, B at 300 with 30% discount. Effective average discount%?

**Answer:**
- SP_A = 500 × 0.80 = 400
- SP_B = 300 × 0.70 = 210
- Total MP = 800, Total SP = 610
- Effective discount = (800-610)/800 × 100 = **23.75%**

**Q2.14: Profit Margin After Discount**

Q: CP = 150, SP = 200 before discount. After 15% discount, SP becomes 170. Profit%?

**Answer:**
- Profit = 170 - 150 = 20
- Profit% = (20/150) × 100 = **13.33%**

# ⏰ **WEDNESDAY: SIMPLE INTEREST - DAY 3 (14K WORDS)**

## TITLE DAY 3 WEDNESDAY SIMPLE INTEREST - PART 1 DAY 3 OBJECTIVE & FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS

**Day 1-2 Mastery Recap:**
- Profit/Loss from CP and SP
- Profit% = (SP-CP)/CP × 100
- Marked Price, Discount, SP relationships
- Dishonest dealing (fake weights)

**Day 3 Mission - SIMPLE INTEREST (SI):**

Interest = "Cost of borrowing money" or "Return on investment"

**Three Perspectives:**
1. **Borrower:** Pays interest for borrowed money
2. **Lender:** Receives interest for lending money
3. **Investor:** Earns interest on invested capital

**Critical Formula (Simple Interest):**

$$\text{SI} = \frac{\text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}}{100}$$

Where:
- **Principal (P):** Initial amount borrowed/invested
- **Rate (R):** Annual interest rate (%)
- **Time (T):** Duration in years
- **SI:** Simple Interest earned/paid

**Amount (Total Money After Interest):**

$$\text{Amount (A)} = \text{Principal} + \text{SI} = P + \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}$$

$$\text{A} = P \left(1 + \frac{R \times T}{100}\right)$$

## TITLE DAY 3 WEDNESDAY SIMPLE INTEREST - PART 2 DEEP CONCEPT: SI AS A RATE (WEEK 5-6 TRANSFER)

**Bridge: SI is a RATE (Just Like Speed in Week 5!)**

| Concept | Week 5 (Speed) | Week 6 Day 1-2 (Profit%) | **Week 6 Day 3 (SI)** |
|---------|---|---|---|
| **Rate Definition** | Distance/Time | Gain/CP | Interest/Year |
| **Example** | 60 km/hr | 20% profit | 8% annual |
| **Formula** | D = S × T | SP = CP(1+P%) | A = P(1+RT/100) |
| **Linear** | Distance increases linearly with time | Gain increases linearly with CP | Interest increases linearly with time |
| **Key** | Proportional relationship | One-time markup | Recurring yearly return |

---

**Why SI is "Simple":**

In SI, interest is always calculated on the **original principal**, not on accumulated interest.

**Example:**
- Principal = 1000, Rate = 10% per year, Time = 3 years
- Year 1: Interest = 1000 × 10% = **100**
- Year 2: Interest = 1000 × 10% = **100** (NOT 1100 × 10%!)
- Year 3: Interest = 1000 × 10% = **100**
- **Total SI = 300** (Linear, simple!)

---

## TITLE DAY 3 WEDNESDAY SIMPLE INTEREST - PART 3 SIMPLE INTEREST WORKED EXAMPLES

**Ex 3.1: Basic SI Calculation**

Q: Principal = 5000, Rate = 8% per annum, Time = 2 years. Find SI and Amount.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: SI Formula**
- SI = (P × R × T) / 100
- SI = (5000 × 8 × 2) / 100
- SI = 80000 / 100 = **800**

**Step 2: Amount**
- A = P + SI = 5000 + 800 = **5800**

OR: A = 5000 × (1 + 8×2/100) = 5000 × 1.16 = **5800**

---

**Ex 3.2: Finding Principal Given SI and Rate**

Q: SI = 600, Rate = 6% per annum, Time = 5 years. Find Principal.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Rearrange SI formula**
- SI = (P × R × T) / 100
- 600 = (P × 6 × 5) / 100
- 600 = 30P / 100
- P = 600 × 100 / 30 = **2000**

**Verification:**
- SI = (2000 × 6 × 5) / 100 = 60000 / 100 = 600 ✓

---

**Ex 3.3: Finding Rate Given Principal, Time, and SI**

Q: Principal = 3000, SI = 450, Time = 3 years. Find Rate%.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Rearrange**
- SI = (P × R × T) / 100
- 450 = (3000 × R × 3) / 100
- 450 = 9000R / 100
- 450 = 90R
- R = 450 / 90 = **5% per annum**

**Verification:**
- SI = (3000 × 5 × 3) / 100 = 45000 / 100 = 450 ✓

---

**Ex 3.4: Finding Time Given Principal, Rate, and SI**

Q: Principal = 8000, Rate = 10% per annum, SI = 4000. Find Time.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Rearrange**
- SI = (P × R × T) / 100
- 4000 = (8000 × 10 × T) / 100
- 4000 = 80000T / 100
- 4000 = 800T
- T = 4000 / 800 = **5 years**

**Verification:**
- SI = (8000 × 10 × 5) / 100 = 400000 / 100 = 4000 ✓

---

**Ex 3.5: Time in Months (Conversion Required)**

Q: Principal = 6000, Rate = 12% per annum, Time = 9 months. Find SI.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Convert months to years**
- 9 months = 9/12 years = 3/4 years = **0.75 years**

**Step 2: Apply SI formula**
- SI = (6000 × 12 × 0.75) / 100
- SI = (6000 × 12 × 3) / (100 × 4)
- SI = 216000 / 400 = **540**

**Verification:**
- 12% annual on 6000 = 720 per year
- 9 months (3/4 of year) = 720 × 0.75 = 540 ✓

---

**Ex 3.6: Time in Days (More Precision)**

Q: Principal = 10000, Rate = 8% per annum, Time = 90 days. Find SI.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Convert days to years**
- Method 1 (365 days/year): 90/365 years
- Method 2 (360 days/year for simple calc): 90/360 = 1/4 = 0.25 years

**Using 365 days (exact):**
- SI = (10000 × 8 × 90) / (100 × 365)
- SI = 7200000 / 36500 ≈ **197.26**

**Using 360 days (approximate, often used in banking):**
- SI = (10000 × 8 × 90) / (100 × 360)
- SI = 7200000 / 36000 = **200**

---

**Ex 3.7: Multiple Investments (Alligation)**

Q: Invest 2000 at 5% and 3000 at 8% for 2 years each. Total SI?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: SI on first investment**
- SI₁ = (2000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 20000 / 100 = **200**

**Step 2: SI on second investment**
- SI₂ = (3000 × 8 × 2) / 100 = 48000 / 100 = **480**

**Step 3: Total SI**
- Total SI = 200 + 480 = **680**

**Step 4: Effective rate on total investment**
- Total Principal = 5000
- Effective rate = (680 / (5000 × 2)) × 100 = (680 / 10000) × 100 = **6.8% per annum**

---

**Ex 3.8: SI with Varying Rates Year-by-Year**

Q: Principal = 5000. Rate Year 1 = 5%, Year 2 = 6%, Year 3 = 7%. Find total SI.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: SI each year (on same principal)**
- SI₁ = (5000 × 5 × 1) / 100 = **250**
- SI₂ = (5000 × 6 × 1) / 100 = **300**
- SI₃ = (5000 × 7 × 1) / 100 = **350**

**Step 2: Total SI**
- Total = 250 + 300 + 350 = **900**

**Formula shortcut:**
- SI = P × (R₁ + R₂ + R₃) / 100 = 5000 × (5+6+7) / 100 = 5000 × 18 / 100 = **900**

---

## TITLE DAY 3 WEDNESDAY SIMPLE INTEREST - PART 4 COMMON MISTAKES DAY 3

**Mistake 1: Calculating Interest on Accumulated Amount (Confusing with CI)**

❌ **Error:** Year 1 interest = 1000 × 10% = 100. Year 2 interest = 1100 × 10% = 110?

✅ **Reality:** In SI, Year 2 interest = 1000 × 10% = 100 (same principal always!)

**Prevention:** "In SI, interest is LINEAR. Always use original principal."

---

**Mistake 2: Forgetting to Convert Time Units**

❌ **Error:** "8 months time, so T = 8?"

✅ **Reality:** T = 8/12 = 2/3 years (convert to years always!)

**Prevention:** "SI formula uses T in YEARS. Always convert months/days to years first."

---

**Mistake 3: Confusing Amount with SI**

❌ **Error:** "SI = 200 means total amount = 200?"

✅ **Reality:** Amount = Principal + SI = 1000 + 200 = 1200

**Prevention:** "SI is only the interest. Amount includes principal + interest."

---

**Mistake 4: Not Handling Varying Rates Correctly**

❌ **Error:** "Rate changes each year, so use average rate for all years?"

✅ **Reality:** Calculate SI for each year separately, then add them up.

**Prevention:** "When rates vary, calculate SI year-by-year, then sum them."

---

Shows: Attention to units, systematic approach.

---

**Tip 3: Use SI Formula Rearrangements Confidently**

"Given: SI = 600, R = 6%, T = 5 years. Find P.
SI = (P × R × T) / 100
600 = (P × 6 × 5) / 100
P = (600 × 100) / (6 × 5) = 60000 / 30 = **2000**"

Shows: Formula mastery, algebraic thinking.

---

**Tip 4: Connect to Week 5-6 Rate Concepts**

"SI is like profit in Week 6: both linear with time/quantity.
Profit = CP × Profit% (one-time)
SI = P × R × T / 100 (recurring yearly)"

Shows: Concept transfer, deep understanding.
