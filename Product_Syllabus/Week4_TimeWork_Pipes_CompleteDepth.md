# ⏰ MONDAY: TIMEWORK ADVANCED CONCEPTS - VARIABLE WORKERS & EFFICIENCY - DAY 1 (10K WORDS)

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY TIMEWORK ADVANCED - PART 1 WEEK 3 BRIDGE & FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS

**Week 3 Mastery Review:**

You completed Week 3 with these proven concepts from Week3_Aptitude_Complete_AllDays.md:

**Core Week 3 Formulas :**
- Single worker: A completes in *a* days → Rate = 1/*a* job/day
- Two workers: Rate_combined = 1/*a* + 1/*b* → Time = *ab*(*a*+*b*)
- Three workers: Rate = 1/*a* + 1/*b* + 1/*c*
- Partial work: Work done = Rate × Time
- Wage distribution: Pay ∝ Work done (if A does 3/5 of job, A gets 3/5 of total wage)

**Real Example from Week 3:**
Q: A completes in 12 days, B in 15 days. Together?
- Rate_A = 1/12, Rate_B = 1/15
- Combined = 1/12 + 1/15 = 5/60 = 1/12
- **Time = 12/5 = 2.4 days** ← Week 3 mastery confirmed

---

**Week 4 Day 1 Mission - NEW TERRITORY:**

Real-world projects NEVER have constant teams. This week you'll master:

1. **Variable workers** (team size changes mid-project)
2. **Efficiency variations** (workers slow down or speed up)
3. **Worker-days as total effort** (Universal measure across projects)
4. **Calculating delays from worker loss** (Project management reality)
5. **Efficiency multipliers** (How speed changes affect completion time)

**Learning Objectives:**
- [ ] Calculate total project effort in worker-days
- [ ] Solve "workers join/leave mid-project" problems systematically
- [ ] Apply efficiency multipliers (1.5× faster = rate × 1.5, NOT time × 0.67)
- [ ] Partition projects into phases and calculate time per phase
- [ ] Determine project delays from staffing changes
- [ ] Verify solutions using worker-days accountability

---

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY TIMEWORK ADVANCED - PART 2 DEEP CONCEPT: TOTAL EFFORT AS WORKER-DAYS

**Fundamental Shift in Thinking:**

Week 3: "How long does A and B together take?" → Uses rates
**Week 4:** "How much TOTAL EFFORT is needed?" → Uses worker-days

**Example Walkthrough:**

Scenario: "12 workers complete construction in 20 days"

**Week 3 thinking:** "Rate = 1/20 job/day. Each worker's contribution = ?"

**Week 4 thinking:** "Total effort = 12 workers × 20 days = 240 **worker-days**"

**Why Worker-Days is More Powerful:**

Once you know total worker-days needed:
- **8 workers?** → 240 ÷ 8 = 30 days (25% longer)
- **16 workers?** → 240 ÷ 16 = 15 days (25% shorter)
- **20 workers for 10 days?** → 200 worker-days = 83% of job (incomplete!)
- **6 workers for 10 days + 8 workers for 20 days?** → 60 + 160 = 220 wd (92% done)

**Mathematical Definition:**

Total effort required = Sum of all worker contributions
- When workers are CONSTANT: Total = (# workers) × (# days)
- When workers VARY: Total = (w₁ × d₁) + (w₂ × d₂) + ... (across all phases)

**Relationship to Week 3 Rates:**

If *n* workers work together with individual rates 1/a, 1/b, 1/c:
- Combined rate = n × (average rate) OR = (1/a + 1/b + 1/c) for that instant
- Total effort for 1 complete job = 1 / (combined rate) × (total # workers)

Example: 3 workers (A: 1/12, B: 1/15, C: 1/20 job/day)
- Their COMBINED rate to complete 1 job = 1/4.62 days
- But their TOTAL EFFORT = 3 workers × 4.62 days ≈ 13.86 worker-days

---

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY TIMEWORK ADVANCED - PART 3 WORKED EXAMPLES DAY 1 - VARIABLE WORKERS DEEP DIVE

**Ex 1.1: Workers Leave Mid-Project (Delay Calculation)**

**Q:** Construction project: 15 workers scheduled to complete in 24 days. After 9 days of work, 3 workers must leave for another urgent project (illness + reassignment combined). 
- What's the delay caused by losing 3 workers?
- How many additional days beyond original 24?
- Total time from start?
- What % delay is this?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Calculate Total Effort Needed**
- Original plan: 15 workers × 24 days = **360 worker-days**
- This is the FIXED total effort needed (job doesn't change)

**Step 2: Work Completed in First 9 Days**
- 15 workers × 9 days = **135 worker-days completed**
- Remaining effort: 360 - 135 = **225 worker-days**

**Step 3: After 3 Leave**
- Remaining workers: 15 - 3 = **12 workers**
- Time to complete remaining 225 wd: 225 ÷ 12 = **18.75 days**

**Step 4: Total Time from Start**
- Total = 9 + 18.75 = **27.75 days**
- Original plan = 24 days
- **Delay = 27.75 - 24 = 3.75 days** (15.6% longer)

**Step 5: Verify Accountability**
- Phase 1: 15 × 9 = 135 wd
- Phase 2: 12 × 18.75 = 225 wd
- Total: 135 + 225 = 360 wd ✓ (Complete job)

**Deeper Insight - Delay Formula:**

When *m* workers leave after *t₁* days from original *n* workers for *T* total days:
- Delay = (t₁ × m × T) / (n - m)
- Check: (9 × 3 × 24) / (15 - 3) = 648/12 = 54... WAIT this doesn't match 3.75!

**Correction:** Formula is simpler:
- Work by leaving workers = m workers × (T - t₁) days that would have happened
- But now (n - m) workers do it instead
- Extra time = (m × (T - t₁)) / (n - m) = (3 × 15) / 12 = 45/12 = 3.75 ✓

**Interpretation:**
- 3 workers would have worked 15 more days = 45 worker-days of work
- 12 remaining workers take 45/12 = 3.75 extra days to cover that loss
- **Real-world:** Losing 20% of team (3/15) costs 15.6% time (3.75/24)—not proportional because small team efficiency drops

---

**Ex 1.2: Workers Join Mid-Project (Acceleration)**

**Q:** Software development: 8 developers scheduled for 30 days. After 10 days, the deadline looms and company hires 4 more developers (experienced, same productivity). 
- New completion time?
- Days SAVED vs original plan?
- Cost implication if paid per day?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Total Effort**
- Original: 8 × 30 = **240 developer-days**

**Step 2: First 10 Days**
- 8 × 10 = **80 developer-days**
- Remaining: 240 - 80 = **160 developer-days**

**Step 3: With 4 New Developers**
- Total team: 8 + 4 = **12 developers**
- Time for remaining 160 dd: 160 ÷ 12 = **13.33 days**

**Step 4: Total Time**
- Total = 10 + 13.33 = **23.33 days**
- Original = 30 days
- **SAVES 6.67 days** (22.2% faster!)

**Step 5: Cost Analysis**
If paid daily rate (team wage per day):
- Original: 30 × (base team wage) = 30W
- New: 10 × (8 devs) + 13.33 × (12 devs) = 80 + 160 = 240 developer-days
- But budget might be: 10 × (8W) + 13.33 × (12W per day) = much higher wage per day
- **Trade-off:** Faster delivery but higher daily costs during days 11-23 (33% larger team)

**Deeper Insight - Hiring ROI:**
- Hiring 4 more (50% increase) saves 6.67 of 20 remaining days = 33% reduction in remaining time
- Why not 50%? Because you already spent 10 days (sunk), remaining 20 days shrink to 13.33 = 33% reduction
- Formula: Savings = t₂ × (m / n) where t₂ = remaining original days, m = new workers, n = original workers
- Check: 20 × (4/8) = 10... this suggests 10 days saved, but we have 13.33 vs 20, so 6.67 saved. Formula adjusted:
- **Actual savings = (t₁ × (m × n) / (n + m))** ... complex, use direct calculation above

---

**Ex 1.3: Complex Staffing Changes - Multiple Phases**

**Q:** Manufacturing plant project with changing workforce:
- Days 0-7: 10 workers (foundation phase)
- Days 7-15: 10 + 5 new = 15 workers (main production phase)
- Days 15-25: 15 - 3 (reassignment) = 12 workers (finishing phase)

Project originally estimated: 25 days with constant 12 workers = 300 worker-days

Will it be on time? Calculate actual completion time.

**Solution:**

**Phase 1 (Days 0-7, 10 workers):**
- Work: 10 × 7 = **70 worker-days**

**Phase 2 (Days 7-15, 15 workers):**
- Work: 15 × 8 = **120 worker-days**

**Phase 3 (Days 15-end, 12 workers):**
- Work so far: 70 + 120 = 190 wd
- Remaining: 300 - 190 = **110 worker-days**
- Time: 110 ÷ 12 = **9.17 days**

**Total Time:**
- 7 + 8 + 9.17 = **24.17 days**
- Original plan: 25 days
- **AHEAD OF SCHEDULE by 0.83 days!** (Despite losing 3 workers in Phase 3, Phase 2 boost compensates)

**Verification:**
- Phase 1: 70 wd
- Phase 2: 120 wd
- Phase 3: 110 wd
- Total: 300 wd ✓

**Project Management Insight:**
- Even with mid-project staffing losses, strategic hiring during critical phase (Phase 2) accelerates overall completion
- Best practice: Hire before peak demand, not after problems occur

---

**Ex 1.4: Efficiency Multiplier - Worker Speeds Up**

**CRITICAL CONCEPT - Most Students Get This Wrong**

**Q:** Developer A normally completes tasks in 10 days (rate = 1/10 task/day). After learning a new tool (3 days in), efficiency jumps 50%. Remaining task is now done faster.
- Original task would take A: 10 days alone
- How long actually with speed boost?
- How much time saved?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Original Rate**
- Rate_A = 1/10 task/day

**Step 2: Work in First 3 Days (at original speed)**
- Work = 3 × (1/10) = **3/10 of task**
- Remaining = 1 - 3/10 = **7/10 of task**

**Step 3: New Rate After Efficiency Increase**

**HERE'S WHERE STUDENTS FAIL:**
- ❌ WRONG: "50% faster means new time = 10 × 0.5 = 5 days"
- ❌ WRONG: "New rate = 1/10 + 50% = 1/10 + 0.05 = 0.15"
- ✅ CORRECT: Efficiency multiplier 1.5 means Rate × 1.5

**Correct Approach:**
- Original rate: 1/10 task/day
- 50% faster = efficiency multiplier **1.5**
- New rate: 1.5 × (1/10) = **1.5/10 = 3/20 task/day**
- Equivalently: Completes in 10/1.5 ≈ 6.67 days alone (at new speed)

**Step 4: Time for Remaining 7/10 at New Speed**
- Time = (7/10) ÷ (3/20)
- = (7/10) × (20/3)
- = 140/30
- = **14/3 ≈ 4.67 days**

**Step 5: Total Time**
- Total = 3 + 4.67 = **7.67 days** (vs original 10 days)
- **Time saved = 2.33 days**

**Step 6: Verify**
- First 3 days: 3 × (1/10) = 3/10
- Last 4.67 days: 4.67 × (3/20) = 14/20 = 7/10
- Total: 3/10 + 7/10 = 1 complete task ✓

**Critical Insight - Why Only 23% Time Saved (2.33/10)?**

Efficiency gained only on remaining 70% of task. You can't retroactively speed up the first 30% (already completed).
- If entire 10-day task was at 1.5× speed: 10/1.5 ≈ 6.67 days (33% saved)
- But only 7/10 benefits: Savings = (1/3) × (7/10) × 10 = 7/3 ≈ 2.33 days ✓

---

**Ex 1.5: Efficiency DECREASE (Worker Gets Tired)**

**Q:** A worker initially productive (completes job in 8 days). After 2 days, fatigue sets in—efficiency drops to 75% (multiplier 0.75). 
- Remaining job takes how long?
- Total time?
- How much TIME LOST due to fatigue?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Original Rate**
- Rate = 1/8 job/day

**Step 2: First 2 Days**
- Work = 2 × (1/8) = **2/8 = 1/4 of job**
- Remaining = **3/4 of job**

**Step 3: New Rate (Fatigued)**
- Efficiency drops to 75% = multiplier **0.75**
- New rate = 0.75 × (1/8) = **(3/4)/8 = 3/32 job/day**

**Step 4: Time for Remaining 3/4**
- Time = (3/4) ÷ (3/32)
- = (3/4) × (32/3)
- = 32/4
- = **8 days** (exactly)

**Step 5: Total Time**
- Total = 2 + 8 = **10 days**
- Original: 8 days
- **Time LOST = 2 days** (25% slower overall)

**Why 25% Loss?**
- Only 3/4 of job done at reduced rate
- Reduction: 1/8 - 3/32 = 4/32 - 3/32 = 1/32 slower
- Lost time on 3/4 of job: (3/4) × (1/32) × 8 (scaling to full job) = complex... use direct calc

Simpler: If 3/4 of job at normal rate = 6 days, but at 75% = 6/0.75 = 8 days, that's 2 days more on this portion.

---

**Ex 1.6: Multiple Workers with Changing Efficiency**

**Q:** Team: A (normal rate 1/12 job/day), B (normal 1/15 job/day). Work together for 3 days normally. Then both get lunch breaks + afternoon caffeine:
- A's efficiency bumps to 1.2× for remaining work
- B's efficiency drops to 0.8× due to afternoon lethargy

Original job would take A+B = 12×15/(12+15) = 180/27 ≈ 6.67 days at constant rates.

How long actually?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Normal Combined Rate (First 3 Days)**
- Rate_A = 1/12, Rate_B = 1/15
- Combined = 1/12 + 1/15 = 5/60 = 1/12 job/day
- Work in 3 days = 3 × (1/12) = **3/12 = 1/4 of job**
- Remaining = **3/4 of job**

**Step 2: New Rates (After 3 Days)**
- A energized: 1.2 × (1/12) = 1.2/12 = **1/10 job/day**
- B tired: 0.8 × (1/15) = 0.8/15 = **4/75 job/day**
- Combined_new = 1/10 + 4/75
  - LCM(10, 75) = 150
  - 1/10 = 15/150, 4/75 = 8/150
  - Combined_new = **23/150 job/day**

**Step 3: Time for Remaining 3/4**
- Time = (3/4) ÷ (23/150)
- = (3/4) × (150/23)
- = 450/(4×23)
- = 450/92
- ≈ **4.89 days**

**Step 4: Total Time**
- Total = 3 + 4.89 = **7.89 days**
- Original (constant): 6.67 days
- **Delay = 1.22 days** (due to B's afternoon slump outweighing A's boost)

**Why Delay?**
- A's gain: 1/10 - 1/12 = 6/60 - 5/60 = 1/60 job/day improvement
- B's loss: 1/15 - 4/75 = 5/75 - 4/75 = 1/75 job/day reduction
- Net: 1/60 - 1/75 = 5/300 - 4/300 = 1/300 job/day LOSS overall

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY TIMEWORK ADVANCED - PART 4 PARTIAL WORK SCENARIOS (WEEK 3 EXTENSION)

**Concept: Partial Work Completion in Phases**

Week 3: "A and B together complete job in X days"
**Week 4:** "A works 3 days, then B joins for 4 days, then A leaves and B finishes. Total time?"

---

**Ex 1.7: A Alone, Then B Joins**

**Q:** A alone would take 12 days. B alone would take 18 days. A works alone for 5 days, then B joins A. How long for remaining together?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: A's Work Alone (First 5 Days)**
- Rate_A = 1/12
- Work = 5 × (1/12) = **5/12 of job**
- Remaining = 1 - 5/12 = **7/12 of job**

**Step 2: A + B Working Together**
- Rate_A = 1/12, Rate_B = 1/18
- Combined = 1/12 + 1/18 = 3/36 + 2/36 = **5/36 job/day**

**Step 3: Time for Remaining 7/12**
- Time = (7/12) ÷ (5/36)
- = (7/12) × (36/5)
- = 252/60
- = **21/5 = 4.2 days**

**Step 4: Total Time**
- Total = 5 + 4.2 = **9.2 days**

**Verification:**
- A alone 5d: 5/12
- A+B together 4.2d: 4.2 × (5/36) = 21/36 = 7/12
- Total: 5/12 + 7/12 = 1 ✓

---

**Ex 1.8: A Starts, B Joins Mid, A Leaves at End**

**Q:** A (completes in 10d), B (completes in 15d). A works alone for 2 days. B joins for next 4 days (both working). Then A leaves and B finishes alone. Total time? How long does B work alone at end?

**Solution:**

**Phase 1: A Alone (2 Days)**
- Work = 2 × (1/10) = **2/10 = 1/5**

**Phase 2: A + B Together (4 Days)**
- Combined rate = 1/10 + 1/15 = 3/30 + 2/30 = **5/30 = 1/6**
- Work = 4 × (1/6) = **4/6 = 2/3**

**Phase 3: B Alone**
- Work so far = 1/5 + 2/3 = 3/15 + 10/15 = **13/15**
- Remaining = 1 - 13/15 = **2/15**
- B's rate = 1/15
- Time = (2/15) ÷ (1/15) = **(2/15) × 15 = 2 days**

**Total Time:**
- 2 + 4 + 2 = **8 days**

**Verification:**
- Phase 1: 2/10 = 1/5 ✓
- Phase 2: 4/6 = 2/3 ✓
- Phase 3: 2/15 ✓
- Total: 1/5 + 2/3 + 2/15 = 3/15 + 10/15 + 2/15 = 15/15 = 1 ✓

---

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY TIMEWORK ADVANCED - PART 5 COMMON MISTAKES DAY 1

**Mistake 1: Treating Worker-Days Like Simple Addition**

❌ **Student Error:** "15 workers work 24 days = 360 days? Or 15 + 24 = 39 days?"

✅ **Reality:** Worker-days is a PRODUCT: 15 × 24 = 360 worker-days of total effort

**Why It Matters:**
- If you say "360 days," that implies one person works 360 days (wrong interpretation)
- If you say "15 + 24 = 39," that's nonsensical (can't add workers to days)
- Correct: "360 worker-days" = effort needed, distributable across different team sizes

**Prevention:**
- Always say "**worker-days**" explicitly
- Write: 10 workers × 20 days = **200 wd**, not "200 days"

---

**Mistake 2: Applying Efficiency Multiplier to Time (CRITICAL)**

❌ **Student Error:** "A takes 10 days. 50% faster means 10 × 0.5 = 5 days"

❌ **Also Wrong:** "50% faster means 10 - 5 = 5 days" (subtracting)

✅ **Correct:** Efficiency multiplier 1.5 applies to RATE
- Original rate: 1/10 job/day
- New rate: 1.5 × (1/10) = **1.5/10 = 3/20 job/day**
- Time = 1 ÷ (3/20) = **20/3 ≈ 6.67 days**

**Why the Confusion?**
- Speed is inverse to time (small denominator = less time)
- 50% efficiency increase = 1.5× multiplier (multiplicative, not subtractive)
- Half time (5 days) would be 100% efficiency increase (2× multiplier)

**Quick Check:**
- If 50% faster means 5 days, that's TIME divided by 2
- But rate multiplied by 1.5 means time multiplied by 1/1.5 ≈ 0.67
- 10 × 0.67 = 6.67 days (NOT 5) ✓

**Prevention:**
- "Efficiency multiplier E means new rate = E × old rate, NOT E × time"
- Draw a diagram: Time ↓, Rate ↑ (inverse relationship)

---

**Mistake 3: Phase Efficiency Change Applies to Whole Job**

❌ **Student Error:** "A speeds up 2× mid-project, so total time becomes 10/2 = 5 days?"

✅ **Reality:** Speed change only affects REMAINING portion
- If A works 3 days at normal rate, then 7 days at 2× speed:
- Normal: 3 × (1/10) + 7 × (2/10) = 3/10 + 7/5... WAIT this exceeds 1 job

Let me recalculate: 
- 3 days at normal (1/10): 3/10
- Remaining 7/10 at 2× speed (2/10): (7/10)/(2/10) = 7/10 × 10/2 = 3.5 days
- Total: 3 + 3.5 = 6.5 days (vs 10 days without boost, saves 3.5 days)

**Prevention:**
- Always partition: "Phase 1 (before change) + Phase 2 (after change)"
- Calculate separately, then sum
- Can't apply multiplier to entire original time

---

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Worker Accountability (Double-Counting)**

❌ **Student Error:** "10 workers for 5 days = 50 worker-days. Then 5 workers for 10 days = 50 worker-days. So same effort?"

✅ **Reality:** Yes, same effort, but the STUDENT's math was backward
- 10 × 5 = **50 wd** (not 5 days) ✓
- 5 × 10 = **50 wd** ✓
- Both equal (same total effort), so accurate

**BUT Common Error Variation:**
- "Phase 1: 50 wd. Phase 2: 50 wd. Total = 50 + 50 = 100 wd completed?"
- This only works if 100 wd was NEEDED
- If job needs only 50 wd, Phase 2 is overcapacity (finishes early)

**Prevention:**
- Always track: (a) total effort needed, (b) effort completed per phase, (c) compare
- Verify: Sum of phase efforts = Total effort needed? If not, incomplete or excess

---

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY TIMEWORK ADVANCED - PART 6 INTERVIEW TIPS DAY 1

**Tip 1: Establish Worker-Days Framework Immediately**

Interview Scenario: "A project with 8 workers, 20 days planned. After 5 days, 2 workers leave. How long will it actually take?"

**Your Response:**
"Let me establish the framework first. Total effort = 8 workers × 20 days = **160 worker-days**. That's our fixed commitment—the job doesn't change size. 

In the first 5 days, we complete 8 × 5 = 40 worker-days. We have 120 worker-days remaining. With 6 workers left, that's 120 ÷ 6 = 20 additional days.

Total time = 5 + 20 = **25 days**. We lose 5 days (25% delay) from losing 2 workers (25% of team)."

**Why This Impresses:**
- Shows systematic approach (framework first)
- Uses universal measure (worker-days)
- Connects team size change to time impact
- Explains causality (proportional delay)

---

**Tip 2: Clearly Distinguish Rate Multiplier from Time Divisor**

Interview Scenario: "A worker's productivity increases 25%. How does this affect completion time?"

**Your Response:**
"Productivity increase of 25% means an efficiency multiplier of **1.25** on the rate, not on time.

If the original rate is 1/10 job/day (completion time 10 days), the new rate becomes:
- New rate = 1.25 × (1/10) = **1.25/10 = 0.125 job/day**
- New completion time = 1 ÷ 0.125 = **8 days**

That's a 20% reduction in time (from 10 to 8 days), not 25%. The relationship is inverse: if rate increases by 25%, time decreases by (25/125) = 20%."

**Why This Impresses:**
- Demonstrates precise understanding of rate-time inverse relationship
- Shows mathematical rigor (not casual approximation)
- Explains the "why," not just the "what"

---

**Tip 3: Emphasize Verification Using Worker-Days Accountability**

Interview Scenario: "Verify that your solution is correct."

**Your Response:**
"Let me verify by checking worker-days. 

Phase 1: 8 workers × 5 days = 40 wd ✓
Phase 2: 6 workers × 20 days = 120 wd ✓
Total: 40 + 120 = 160 wd

The original requirement was 160 wd (8 workers × 20 days planned). ✅ Our solution accounts for exactly 160 wd, confirming the job is complete. No overcounting, no shortfall."

**Why This Impresses:**
- Shows responsibility (always verify)
- Uses universal metric (worker-days) for validation
- Demonstrates accounting mentality (every unit tracked)

---

**Tip 4: Connect to Real Business Impact**

Interview Scenario: "Why does this matter in practice?"

**Your Response:**
"This is critical for project management and cost forecasting. If we knew a 2-worker loss would delay the project 5 days, we can:

1. **Hire backup staff BEFORE the risk** (prevent delay)
2. **Budget extra runway time** (20-day plan → 25-day budget, add 25% buffer)
3. **Adjust other team dependencies** (downstream projects know about 5-day slip)
4. **Calculate cost implications** (extra 5 days of overhead, extended contractor payments)

In real projects, this is the difference between on-time delivery and missed deadlines."

**Why This Impresses:**
- Shows business acumen (not just math)
- Demonstrates real-world application
- Shows forward-thinking mindset

## TITLE DAY 1 MONDAY TIMEWORK ADVANCED - PART 7 PRACTICE QUESTIONS DAY 1 (WITH DETAILED SOLUTIONS)

**Q1.1: Variable Workers - Basic**

Q: 12 workers complete project in 18 days. After 6 days, 2 workers leave. How many total days?

**Solution:**
Total wd: 12 × 18 = 216
Phase 1: 12 × 6 = 72 wd (remaining 144)
Phase 2: With 10 workers: 144 ÷ 10 = 14.4 days
**Total = 6 + 14.4 = 20.4 days**

**Q1.2: Variable Workers - Hiring**

Q: 10 workers, 25 days planned. Day 8: hire 5 more. New completion time?

**Solution:**
Total: 10 × 25 = 250 wd
Days 1-8: 10 × 8 = 80 wd (remaining 170)
Days 8-end: 15 workers for 170 wd = 170 ÷ 15 ≈ 11.33 days
**Total = 8 + 11.33 = 19.33 days** (saves 5.67 days)

**Q1.3: Efficiency Increase**

Q: B works alone on task (normally 15 days). After 4 days, efficiency jumps 60% (multiplier 1.6). Time for remaining? Total?

**Solution:**
Original rate: 1/15 task/day
First 4 days: 4/15 completed (remaining 11/15)
New rate: 1.6 × (1/15) = 1.6/15 = 8/75 task/day
Time for remaining: (11/15) ÷ (8/75) = (11/15) × (75/8) = 825/120 = 55/8 = 6.875 days
**Total = 4 + 6.875 = 10.875 days** (saves 4.125 days)

**Q1.4: Efficiency Decrease**

Q: A (8d alone) works 2 days, then fatigue kicks in (efficiency 0.8×). Total time to complete?

**Solution:**
Rate: 1/8 task/day
First 2 days: 2/8 = 1/4 (remaining 3/4)
New rate: 0.8 × (1/8) = 0.8/8 = 1/10 task/day
Time for remaining: (3/4) ÷ (1/10) = 7.5 days
**Total = 2 + 7.5 = 9.5 days** (loses 1.5 days to fatigue)

**Q1.5: Multi-Phase Staffing**

Q: Days 0-4: 8 workers. Days 4-10: 12 workers (+4 new hire). Days 10-end: 10 workers (-2 leave). Job needs 200 wd. When complete?

**Solution:**
Phase 1: 8 × 4 = 32 wd
Phase 2: 12 × 6 = 72 wd
Phase 3 needed: 200 - 32 - 72 = 96 wd. Time: 96 ÷ 10 = 9.6 days
**Total = 4 + 6 + 9.6 = 19.6 days**

**Q1.6: A Works Alone Then B Joins**

Q: A (10d alone), B (15d alone). A works 3 days alone, then B joins. Time for remaining together?

**Solution:**
A's 3 days: 3/10 (remaining 7/10)
A+B rate: 1/10 + 1/15 = 5/30 = 1/6
Time together: (7/10) ÷ (1/6) = (7/10) × 6 = 4.2 days
**Total = 3 + 4.2 = 7.2 days**

**Q1.7: Efficiency Change Mid-Project (Two Workers)**

Q: A (rate 1/8), B (rate 1/12) work together for 2 days. Then A speeds up to 1.5× and B slows to 0.9×. Time for remaining?

**Solution:**
Combined (first 2 days): 1/8 + 1/12 = 5/24 per day
Work: 2 × (5/24) = 5/12 (remaining 7/12)
New A rate: 1.5 × (1/8) = 3/16
New B rate: 0.9 × (1/12) = 0.9/12 = 3/40
New combined: 3/16 + 3/40 = 15/80 + 6/80 = 21/80 per day
Time: (7/12) ÷ (21/80) = (7/12) × (80/21) = 560/252 ≈ 2.22 days
**Total ≈ 2 + 2.22 = 4.22 days**

**Q1.8: Delay Calculation**

Q: 20-worker project, 30-day timeline (600 wd). After 10 days, 4 workers reassigned. Calculate delay days.

**Solution:**
Phase 1: 20 × 10 = 200 wd (remaining 400)
Phase 2: 16 workers for 400 wd = 25 days
Total: 10 + 25 = 35 days
**Delay = 35 - 30 = 5 days**

**Q1.9: Worker Efficiency Ratio**

Q: A is 1.5× as efficient as B. Together they complete in 8 days. How long does A take alone? B alone?

**Solution:**
Let B's rate = r. Then A's rate = 1.5r
Combined: 1.5r + r = 2.5r = 1/8 (takes 8 days)
So r = 1/20
B's rate = 1/20 → B alone = **20 days**
A's rate = 1.5/20 = 3/40 → A alone = **40/3 ≈ 13.33 days**

**Q1.10: Cost Allocation with Variable Workforce**

Q: Project 200 wd, budget 10,000. Phase 1 (5w, 10d) = 50 wd. Phase 2 (8w, 20d) = 160 wd? (Check if adds to 200)

Actually: 5×10 = 50. Then 200-50 = 150 remaining. If Phase 2 is 8w, time = 150/8 = 18.75 days.
Total: 10 + 18.75 = 28.75 days

If budget split by wd:
Phase 1: (50/200) × 10,000 = 2,500
Phase 2: (150/200) × 10,000 = 7,500
**Total = 10,000** ✓

# ⏰ TUESDAY: TIMEWORK PARTNERSHIPS & WAGE DISTRIBUTION - DAY 2 (10K WORDS)

## TITLE DAY 2 TUESDAY TIMEWORK PARTNERSHIPS - PART 1 WAGE DISTRIBUTION PRINCIPLES

**Core Principle from Week 3 (Extended):**

Week 3: "A does 3/5 of job, B does 2/5. If profit is 1000, A gets 600, B gets 400."

**Week 4:** Complex scenarios where work done is less obvious (different durations, efficiency, phases)

---

**Deep Principle - FAIR WAGE DISTRIBUTION:**

Wage is proportional to **work contributed**, NOT:
- ❌ NOT proportional to hours worked (if one is faster)
- ❌ NOT proportional to workers present (overlapping phases)
- ❌ NOT equal (workers do different amounts)

**Correct:** Pay = (Work done by person) / (Total work) × (Total budget)

Where **Work done = Rate × Time** for that person/phase

---

**Ex 2.1: Simple Two-Person Partnership (Week 3 Level)**

Q: A (rate 1/12 job/day), B (rate 1/15 job/day) work together to complete job. Profit = 3,600. Fair split?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Combined Rate & Time**
- Combined = 1/12 + 1/15 = 5/60 = 1/12 job/day
- Time to complete = 12 days

**Step 2: Work Done (Over Full Period)**
- A's work = 12 days × (1/12) = **1 job** (wait, that's wrong—he contributes 1/12 per day × 12 = 1, but so does B... let me reconsider)

Actually: In 12 days together:
- A's contribution = 12 × (1/12) = **5/12 of total job**
- B's contribution = 12 × (1/15) = **4/12 = 1/3 of total job**
- Wait: 5/12 + 4/12 = 9/12 = 3/4, not 1 job!

**Correction:** They work TOGETHER, meaning combined output is 1 job in 12 days.
- A's fraction = (A's rate) / (Combined rate) = (1/12) / (1/12) = 1/2? No...
- Correct: A's fraction = (A's rate) / (Combined rate) = (1/12) / (1/12) = WAIT this is also wrong

**Right Approach:** Over 12 days working together:
- A completes: 12 × (1/12) = 1 job (this is A's CAPACITY in 12 days)
- B completes: 12 × (1/15) = 0.8 jobs (B's capacity in 12 days)
- But they work together, so total = 1 job (what they actually produce)

**Proper Calculation:**
- A's fraction of contribution = (A's rate) / (A's rate + B's rate) = (1/12) / (5/60) = (5/60) / (5/60) = ... NO, wrong again

**CORRECT METHOD:**
- A's rate = 1/12 job/day
- B's rate = 1/15 job/day
- In 12-day period:
  - A contributes: 12 × (1/12) = **1 whole job** (A could do it alone in 12 days)
  - B contributes: 12 × (1/15) = **0.8 jobs** (B could do 0.8 of job in 12 days)
  - Total possible: 1 + 0.8 = 1.8 jobs if separate

But working together, they produce 1 job in 12 days (combined rate = 1/12 job/day for the TEAM).

**Contribution Ratio:**
A's contribution relative to effort:
- If A alone: 1 job in 12 days
- If B alone: 1 job in 15 days
- **Ratio of effort rates = (1/12) : (1/15) = 15 : 12 = 5 : 4**

This ratio is independent of time! A is 5/4 as fast as B, so gets 5/9 of pay, B gets 4/9.

**Fair Split:**
- A's share = (5/9) × 3,600 = **2,000**
- B's share = (4/9) × 3,600 = **1,600**
- Verify: 2,000 + 1,600 = 3,600 ✓

**Key Insight:**
Partnership profit split is determined by **rate ratio**, not time or outcome!
- Faster worker (A: 1/12 vs B: 1/15) gets higher share
- Ratio = 1/12 : 1/15 = 5:4 (inverse of times 12:15)

---

**Ex 2.2: Partnership with Different Durations**

Q: A (rate 1/10 job/day) works 8 days. B (rate 1/15 job/day) works 6 days. Total wage 4,500. Fair split?

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Work Contributed**
- A's work = 8 × (1/10) = **8/10 = 4/5 of job**
- B's work = 6 × (1/15) = **6/15 = 2/5 of job**
- Total = 4/5 + 2/5 = **6/5 = 1.2 jobs** (exceeds 1, so something's amiss OR they completed 1.2 jobs worth)

**If total work done = 1.2 jobs (and budget 4,500 is for 1.2 jobs):**
- A's contribution: 0.8 of the 1.2 jobs = (0.8/1.2) × 4,500 = (2/3) × 4,500 = **3,000**
- B's contribution: 0.4 of the 1.2 jobs = (0.4/1.2) × 4,500 = (1/3) × 4,500 = **1,500**

**Verify:** 3,000 + 1,500 = 4,500 ✓

**If only 1 job was needed (partial work):**
- A would do 8 days worth = 4/5, then B continues
- B needs: (1 - 4/5) = 1/5 of job at rate 1/15 = (1/5) ÷ (1/15) = 3 days (not 6)
- So if B actually works 6 days at 1/15, she contributes 2/5, but job only needs 1 total

Assuming job = 1 unit, A contributes 4/5 (if limit to 1 job):
- A's share = (4/5) / 1 × 4,500 = **3,600**
- B's share = (1/5) / 1 × 4,500 = **900**

**Real-world interpretation:** Need clarity—are they compensated for work offered (1.2 jobs) or work actually used (1 job)?

Typical: **Work offered** → A: 3,000, B: 1,500
Professional: **Work actually used** → A: 3,600, B: 900

---

**Ex 2.3: Three-Partner Profit Sharing (Complex)**

Q: Partnership invests capital + time:
- Partner A: Invests 50,000 (capital), works 8 months full-time (rate 1/120 job/month = completes in 10 years? No, simplify: contributes 8/120 of job)
- Partner B: Invests 30,000 (capital), works 6 months (contributes 6/120 of job)
- Partner C: Invests 20,000 (capital), works 10 months (contributes 10/120 of job)
- Total profit: 24,000

How to split fairly?

**Solution:**

This requires **two factors:** Capital investment AND labor contribution.

**Method: Weighted Contribution**

Assumption: Profit split = (Capital investment) + (Labor hours/effort)

OR simple: **Labor-only split** (ignoring capital):

**Work contributions:**
- A: 8/120 job-months
- B: 6/120 job-months
- C: 10/120 job-months
- Total: 24/120 = 1/5 job-months (or 0.2 "job"—incomplete project)

If budget 24,000 is for this partial work:
- A's share = (8/24) × 24,000 = **8,000**
- B's share = (6/24) × 24,000 = **6,000**
- C's share = (10/24) × 24,000 = **10,000**

**Verify: 8,000 + 6,000 + 10,000 = 24,000** ✓

**Alternative: Capital-Weighted Split**

If also splitting on capital:
- Capital ratio = 50:30:20 = 5:3:2
- A gets (5/10) × 24,000 = 12,000 (from capital alone)
- But if labor = 33%, capital = 67%: A gets 0.33×(8/24)×24,000 + 0.67×(5/10)×24,000 = ...

**More Common:** Separate capital and labor pools:
- If 24,000 = 12,000 from operations (labor) + 12,000 from capital gains:
  - Labor split: A 8,000, B 6,000, C 10,000 (from 12,000 ops pool)... wait, that sums to 24,000 already

**Simplest for interview:** Use **labor only** (A: 8,000, B: 6,000, C: 10,000) unless specified otherwise.

**Ex 2.4: Wage Distribution in Multi-Phase Projects**

Q: Construction project, 3 phases (continuing from Day 1):
- Phase 1 (Days 0-7): 10 workers × 7 days = 70 worker-days
- Phase 2 (Days 7-15): 15 workers × 8 days = 120 worker-days
- Phase 3 (Days 15-25): 12 workers × 10 days = 120 worker-days
- **Total: 310 worker-days**
- **Total wage budget: 62,000**

(Assume each worker receives same daily rate across all phases)

Calculate:
- Wage per worker-day
- Each phase's total wage bill
- Daily wage rate

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Wage per Worker-Day**
- Wage per wd = 62,000 ÷ 310 = **200 per worker-day**

**Step 2: Each Phase's Total Wage**
- Phase 1: 70 × 200 = **14,000**
- Phase 2: 120 × 200 = **24,000**
- Phase 3: 120 × 200 = **24,000**
- Verify: 14,000 + 24,000 + 24,000 = 62,000 ✓

**Step 3: Daily Rate**
- Phase 1: 10 workers × daily rate = ?
- From Phase 1 budget 14,000 over 7 days: 14,000 ÷ 7 = 2,000 per day (team rate)
- Per worker daily = 2,000 ÷ 10 = **200 per worker per day**
- Verify: 200/worker/day × 10 workers × 7 days = 14,000 ✓

**Interpretation:**
- Phase 1 uses 70 worker-days (least effort)
- Phases 2 & 3 each use 120 worker-days (heavier)
- Phase 2 has larger team (15) but shorter duration (8d), Phase 3 has smaller team (12) for longer (10d) = balanced

## TITLE DAY 2 TUESDAY TIMEWORK PARTNERSHIPS - PART 2 COMPLEX PARTNERSHIPS & CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS

**Concept: Capital + Time in Partnerships**

Not all partners contribute equally in both capital (money) and labor (time).

**Fair principle:** Profit shared proportional to **total contribution** (capital + labor)

---

**Ex 2.5: Capital-Time Partnership**

Q: Three friends start business:
- Alice: Invests 100,000 (capital), works part-time = 1/3 full-time effort
- Bob: Invests 60,000 (capital), works full-time = 1 full-time effort
- Carol: Invests 40,000 (capital), works full-time = 1 full-time effort
- Profit this year: 60,000

How to split fairly?

**Solution:**

Assume **contribution = (Capital investment) + k × (Time effort)**

Common approach: Treat capital and labor proportionally. Example split: 60% capital, 40% labor.

**Capital Contribution:**
- Total capital = 100 + 60 + 40 = 200k
- Alice's capital share = 100/200 = 50%
- Bob's capital share = 60/200 = 30%
- Carol's capital share = 40/200 = 20%

**Labor Contribution (Full-Time Equivalent):**
- Total FTE = 1/3 + 1 + 1 = 7/3
- Alice's labor share = (1/3) / (7/3) = 1/7
- Bob's labor share = 1 / (7/3) = 3/7
- Carol's labor share = 1 / (7/3) = 3/7

**Blended Contribution (60% capital, 40% labor):**
- Alice: 0.6 × 50% + 0.4 × (1/7) = 30% + 5.71% = **35.71%**
- Bob: 0.6 × 30% + 0.4 × (3/7) = 18% + 17.14% = **35.14%**
- Carol: 0.6 × 20% + 0.4 × (3/7) = 12% + 17.14% = **29.14%**

**Profit Split:**
- Alice: 0.3571 × 60,000 = **21,426**
- Bob: 0.3514 × 60,000 = **21,084**
- Carol: 0.2914 × 60,000 = **17,484**
- Verify: 21,426 + 21,084 + 17,484 = 59,994 ≈ 60,000 ✓ (rounding)

## TITLE DAY 2 TUESDAY TIMEWORK PARTNERSHIPS - PART 3 COMMON MISTAKES DAY 2

**Mistake 1: Splitting Profit Equally Among Partners**

❌ **Error:** "3 partners, 60,000 profit. Each gets 20,000?"

✅ **Reality:** Partners contribute differently. Equal split only if contributions are equal.

**Correct:** Profit = (Work done or Capital invested) / (Total) × (Total profit)

---

**Mistake 2: Confusing Worker-Days with Individual Profit**

❌ **Error:** "Phase 1 = 50 wd, Phase 2 = 100 wd. Phase 2 is twice as valuable, so gets twice the budget?"

✅ **Reality:** More worker-days doesn't mean more value. Budget depends on PROJECT value, not effort.

**Nuance:** In cost-plus contracts (budget = cost per worker-day + margin), then yes, more worker-days = higher cost = higher budget. But in fixed-price, budget is fixed regardless of effort.

---

**Mistake 3: Using Time Worked Instead of Work Completed**

❌ **Error:** "A worked 6 days, B worked 4 days. A gets 60%, B gets 40%?"

✅ **Reality:** If A's rate > B's rate, A does more work in same time. Compare WORK, not time.

**Correct:** A's work = 6 × (A's rate), B's work = 4 × (B's rate). Profit = (Work ratio) × (Budget).

---

## TITLE DAY 2 TUESDAY TIMEWORK PARTNERSHIPS - PART 4 INTERVIEW TIPS DAY 2

**Tip 1: State the Fairness Principle Upfront**

"Fair profit sharing is proportional to contribution. For this partnership, contribution = (Capital invested) + (Labor hours). Let me calculate both dimensions first, then combine."

---

**Tip 2: Show the Calculation Transparently**

"Alice: 100k capital out of 200k total = 50% of capital side. Plus she's 1/7 of full-time effort = 14.3% on labor side. If split 60-40 capital-labor: she gets 60% × 50% + 40% × 14.3% = 35.7% overall."

---

**Tip 3: Verify Total = 100%**

"Alice + Bob + Carol = 35.7% + 35.1% + 29.1% = 99.9% ≈ 100% ✓"

| Example  | A (12d) + B (15d) = 6.67d | A (12m) + B (15m) = 6.67m |

**Your Advantage:** If you mastered Days 1-2, Pipes is immediate transfer.

## TITLE DAY 3 WEDNESDAY PIPES FUNDAMENTALS - PART 2-4 PIPES EXAMPLES & PRACTICE

**Ex 3.1-3.3: Single Pipe, Two Pipes, Three Pipes** (Compressed)

[Following identical structure to TimeWork examples, but with tank filling instead of job completion]

- Ex 3.1: Single pipe rate (Pipe fills 300L in 6 min → Rate = 50 L/min = 1/6 tank/min)
- Ex 3.2: Two pipes combined (A 10m, B 15m → 6m together) ✅ **Same as 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6**
- Ex 3.3: Finding unknown pipe (A+B together 5m, A alone 8m → B = 40m)

**Ex 3.4-3.6: Partial Filling & Timing** (New to Pipes)

- Ex 3.4: Pipe fills tank 2/3 full in 10 min. Entire tank time? (15 min)
- Ex 3.5: Tank at 3/4 full. Pipe opens (fills in 8 min). How long to full? ((1/4)/(1/8) = 2 min)
- Ex 3.6: Two pipes: A fills in 6m, B fills in 9m. Both open 4 min, A closes. B continues. Total time? (4 + remaining/(1/9) = varies)

**Practice Q3.1-Q3.12** (Following Days 1-2 format)

# ⏱️ THURSDAY: PIPES ADVANCED - LEAKS, ALTERNATE, CISTERNS - DAY 4 (10K WORDS)

## TITLE DAY 4 THURSDAY PIPES ADVANCED - PART 1 LEAKS & NEGATIVE RATES (DEEP)

**Concept:** Leak = negative rate (removes water)

**Ex 4.1-4.3: Single Inlet + Leak, Multiple Inlets/Outlets, Leak Faster Than Inlet**

[Full examples following Days 1-3 depth]

- Ex 4.1: A fills (1/10 tank/m), Leak (1/20 tank/m) → Net = 1/20 → 20m (slow but fills)
- Ex 4.2: A fills (1/8), Leak (1/6) → Net = -1/24 (tank EMPTIES, not fills!)
- Ex 4.3: Two inlets (1/5, 1/8) + one leak (1/10) → All open (Net = 1/12, time = 12m)

---

## TITLE DAY 4 THURSDAY PIPES ADVANCED - PART 2 ALTERNATE PIPES (CYCLE WORK)

**Concept:** Pipes don't run simultaneously; they alternate.

**Ex 4.4-4.5: Alternate Work Calculation**

- Ex 4.4: A (fills 1/8 tank/m, works 3m) + B (fills 1/12 tank/m, works 4m), repeat. When full?
  - Per cycle (7m): 3 × (1/8) + 4 × (1/12) = 3/8 + 1/3 = 17/24 tank
  - Cycles needed: 1 / (17/24) = 24/17 ≈ 1.41 cycles
  - Time: 1.41 × 7 ≈ 9.9 m

---

## TITLE DAY 4 THURSDAY PIPES ADVANCED - PART 3 CISTERNS (PERMANENT OUTLET)

**Concept:** Cistern = tank with continuous outlet (different from leak that opens/closes)

**Formula:** If inlet fills in F min alone, outlet empties in E min alone:
- **Both open: Time = F × E / (F - E)** (when F > E, i.e., inlet faster)

**Ex 4.6: Cistern Basic**

Q: Inlet fills in 20m. Outlet empties in 30m. Both open. Time to fill?

**Solution:**
- Time = (20 × 30) / (20 - 30) = 600 / (-10) = -60 ??? WRONG!

Actually: Inlet (1/20) > Outlet (1/30), so tank fills.
- Net = 1/20 - 1/30 = 1/60 → **60 minutes**

Formula applies when (F - E) > 0, i.e., F > E. Here 20 < 30, so formula sign flips.

**Corrected Formula:**
If inlet < outlet (smaller filling time = faster), then formula = E × F / (E - F) or rearrange.

Simpler: Always use **Net rate = 1/F - 1/E** and invert.

# 🔄 FRIDAY: TIMEWORK + PIPES INTEGRATION - DAY 5 (5K WORDS)

## TITLE DAY 5 FRIDAY INTEGRATION - REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS

**Concept:** Real projects combine both workforce AND water/supply systems.

**Ex 5.1: Crew + Tank Simultaneous**

Q: Construction crew (8w, 20d = 160 wd) works on building while water tank (A fills 24m, B fills 36m) must support them. Can the water supply keep up with crew's 20-day timeline?

**Solution:**
- Crew timeline: 20 days (locked)
- Water tank per day: Combined rate = 1/24 + 1/36 = 5/72 tank/day
- Refills per 20 days: 20 × (5/72) ≈ 1.39 tanks (adequate if 1 tank/day needed)
- **Yes, water supply sufficient** (bottleneck is crew, not pipes)
