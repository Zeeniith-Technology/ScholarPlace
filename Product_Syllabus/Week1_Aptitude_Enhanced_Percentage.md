## 📅 DAY 1: INTEGERS – UNDERSTANDING NUMBERS ABOVE & BELOW ZERO

### 1. Why Integers Are Needed (Real-World Context)

**Historical Perspective:**
- Initially, humans only used counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4...
- But real life involves scenarios beyond simple counting:
  - **Loss** - Debt, deficit, withdrawal
  - **Temperature** - Below freezing
  - **Positions** - Underground levels, below sea level
  - **Direction** - Gains and losses in stock markets

**Problem without integers:**
If you have ₹300 and spend ₹450, the difference cannot be expressed with natural numbers alone.

### 2. Definition of Integers (Formal & Simple)

**Mathematical Definition:**
Integers are the set of all whole numbers including positive numbers, zero, and negative numbers, without any fractional or decimal parts.

**Notation:**
```
Z = {…, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …}
```

**Classification:**
- **Positive Integers:** Z⁺ = {1, 2, 3, 4, …}
- **Negative Integers:** Z⁻ = {…, -4, -3, -2, -1}
- **Zero:** 0 (neither positive nor negative)
- **Non-negative Integers:** {0, 1, 2, 3, …}
- **Non-positive Integers:** {…, -3, -2, -1, 0}

**Key Distinction:**

| Term | Includes | Example |
|------|----------|---------| 
| Natural Numbers (N) | Counting numbers only | 1, 2, 3, 4... |
| Whole Numbers (W) | 0 + Natural numbers | 0, 1, 2, 3... |
| Integers (Z) | Positive + 0 + Negative | -2, -1, 0, 1, 2... |

### 3. Real-Life Applications of Integers

**Case 1: Financial Transaction**
```
Initial Balance: ₹300
Expense: ₹450
Final Balance: 300 - 450 = -150
Interpretation: You owe ₹150 (debt of ₹150)
```

**Case 2: Temperature Variations**
```
Morning: +3°C (above freezing)
Evening: -4°C (below freezing)
Difference: 3 - (-4) = 7°C drop
```

**Case 3: Elevator/Building Levels**
```
Ground Floor: 0
First Floor: +1
Basement Level 1: -1
Parking Level 2: -2
Underground Store: -3
```

**Case 4: Stock Market**
```
Profit: +₹5000
Loss: -₹3000
Net Change: +₹5000 - ₹3000 = +₹2000
```

### 4. The Number Line (Visual & Conceptual Foundation)

```
    ←  DECREASING  ←                 →  INCREASING  →
    
-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    ↑                       ↑                     ↑
 Negatives               Reference           Positives
```

**Number Line Rules:**
1. Moving RIGHT → value INCREASES
2. Moving LEFT → value DECREASES
3. Zero is the reference point (origin)
4. Distance from zero determines absolute value
5. For negative numbers: **closer to zero = greater value**

**Visual Distance Concept:**
```
-5 is 5 units away from 0
-1 is 1 unit away from 0
Therefore: -1 > -5 (because -1 is closer to 0)
```

### 5. Comparing Integers (Systematic Method)

**Comparison Rule 1: Sign First**
```
Positive > Zero > Negative
5 > 0 > -3
```

**Comparison Rule 2: Among Negatives**
```
The negative number CLOSER to zero is GREATER
-3 > -8  (because -3 is closer to 0)
-1 > -100
-50 > -75
```

**Comparison Rule 3: Among Positives (Same as Natural Numbers)**
```
7 > 3
100 > 25
```

**Quick Comparison Trick:**
On a number line, the number that appears to the RIGHT is always greater.

### 6. Worked Examples (Day 1)

**Example 1.1: Simple Positive vs Negative**
```
Q: Which is greater: -5 or 2?
Solution:
  Rule: Positive > Negative
  2 is positive, -5 is negative
  ✅ Answer: 2 > -5
```

**Example 1.2: Comparing Two Negatives**
```
Q: Which is greater: -3 or -8?
Solution:
  Both are negative
  -3 is 3 units from 0
  -8 is 8 units from 0
  -3 is closer to 0, so -3 is greater
  ✅ Answer: -3 > -8
```

**Example 1.3: Arranging Multiple Integers**
```
Q: Arrange in ascending order: -4, 6, 0, -1, 3
Solution:
  Step 1: Identify groups
    Negative: -4, -1
    Zero: 0
    Positive: 3, 6
  
  Step 2: Order negatives (closer to 0 is greater)
    -4 < -1
  
  Step 3: Combine groups
    -4, -1, 0, 3, 6
  ✅ Answer: -4 < -1 < 0 < 3 < 6
```

**Example 1.4: Real-World Temperature**
```
Q: Cities A, B, C have temperatures -7°C, -2°C, 5°C respectively.
   Which city is coldest?
Solution:
  Coldest means lowest temperature (most negative)
  -7 < -2 < 5
  ✅ Answer: City A (-7°C) is coldest
```

**Example 1.5: Financial Calculation**
```
Q: A person has ₹100. They need to pay ₹250.
   What is their financial position?
Solution:
  Available: +₹100
  Need to pay: -₹250
  Position: 100 - 250 = -₹150
  ✅ Answer: They are in debt of ₹150
```

**Example 1.6: Mixed Operations**
```
Q: Temperature was -3°C. It increased by 8°C. 
   What is the new temperature?
Solution:
  Initial: -3°C
  Change: +8°C
  New: -3 + 8 = 5°C
  ✅ Answer: 5°C
```

### 7. Common Mistakes (Day 1)

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Thinking -10 > -5 | Absolute value comparison only | -5 > -10 (closer to 0) |
| Assuming 0 is positive | 0 is neither positive nor negative | Remember the neutral origin |
| Forgetting sign in calculation | -5 + 3 ≠ 8 | -5 + 3 = -2 |
| Comparing without line | Mental confusion | Always visualize number line |

### 8. Interview Tips (Day 1)

💡 **Tip 1:** Always use number line for comparison questions - visual clarity saves time.
💡 **Tip 2:** Negative numbers closer to 0 are GREATER - remember "closer = bigger"
💡 **Tip 3:** In real-world problems, negative = loss/debt/below reference point
💡 **Tip 4:** Practice quick comparison without writing - build mental agility

### 9. Practice Questions (Day 1) - 6 Questions

## 📅 DAY 2: FACTORS – BREAKING NUMBERS INTO BUILDING BLOCKS

### 1. Definition of Factors (Formal & Simple)

**Mathematical Definition:**
A factor of a number N is any whole number that divides N completely with remainder = 0.

**Notation:**
If a is a factor of b, then: b ÷ a = c (where c is an integer and remainder = 0)

**Simple Way:**
"Factors are numbers that go into a number perfectly without leaving anything behind."

### 2. Understanding Factors (Real-World Context)

**Scenario 1: Chocolate Distribution**
```
12 chocolates → distribute equally among groups
- Among 1 child? ✅ Yes (12 ÷ 1 = 12)
- Among 2 children? ✅ Yes (12 ÷ 2 = 6 each)
- Among 3 children? ✅ Yes (12 ÷ 3 = 4 each)
- Among 4 children? ✅ Yes (12 ÷ 4 = 3 each)
- Among 5 children? ❌ No (12 ÷ 5 = 2.4 each)
- Among 6 children? ✅ Yes (12 ÷ 6 = 2 each)

So: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 are factors of 12
```

**Scenario 2: Arranging Seats**
```
100 seats in classroom
Can arrange as:
- 1 × 100 (1 row, 100 columns)
- 2 × 50 (2 rows, 50 columns)
- 4 × 25 (4 rows, 25 columns)
- 5 × 20 (5 rows, 20 columns)
- 10 × 10 (10 rows, 10 columns)

Factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
```

### 3. Methods to Find Factors

**Method 1: Systematic Division Approach**

```
To find all factors of a number N:

Step 1: Start with 1 (always a factor)
Step 2: Test each number from 2 to √N
Step 3: If a number divides N perfectly, it's a factor
Step 4: Include its pair (N ÷ factor)
Step 5: Stop when you reach √N to avoid repetition
```

**Method 2: Prime Factorization Approach**

```
Example: Find factors of 18
Step 1: Prime factorization
  18 = 2 × 3²
  
Step 2: Find all combinations
  2⁰ × 3⁰ = 1
  2¹ × 3⁰ = 2
  2⁰ × 3¹ = 3
  2¹ × 3¹ = 6
  2⁰ × 3² = 9
  2¹ × 3² = 18
  
Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
```

**Method 3: Factor Pairs**

```
Find pairs of numbers whose product equals N:

For 18:
1 × 18 = 18
2 × 9 = 18
3 × 6 = 18

Factors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
```

### 4. Prime vs Composite Numbers

**Prime Numbers (Foundation Concept)**

**Definition:**
A prime number is:
- Greater than 1
- Divisible only by 1 and itself
- Has exactly 2 factors

**Examples:**
```
2: factors = {1, 2}
3: factors = {1, 3}
5: factors = {1, 5}
7: factors = {1, 7}
11: factors = {1, 11}
13: factors = {1, 13}
```

**Important Prime Facts:**
- **2 is the ONLY even prime number**
- **3 is the ONLY odd prime number less than 5**
- All primes > 3 are of form (6n ± 1)

**Prime Numbers Up to 100:**
```
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47,
53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97

## 📅 DAY 3: DIVISIBILITY – CHECKING WITHOUT DIVISION

### 1. Why Divisibility Rules Matter

**Real-World Importance:**
- Quick mental calculations without calculator
- Exam strategy: Save time on long divisions
- Finding patterns in numbers
- Testing correctness of multiplication

**Time Advantage:**
```
Without rule: 67891 ÷ 9 = ? (needs long division, 30+ seconds)
With rule: Sum of digits = 6+7+8+9+1 = 31, not divisible by 9 (5 seconds)
```

### 2. Complete Divisibility Rules with Proofs

**RULE 1: Divisibility by 2**

**Rule Statement:**
A number is divisible by 2 if its **unit digit (last digit) is even** (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).

**Why It Works:**
```
Any number N = 10a + b (where b is unit digit)
10a is always even (divisible by 2)
So N is divisible by 2 ⟺ b is even
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ 248 → last digit 8 (even) → divisible by 2
✅ 756 → last digit 6 (even) → divisible by 2
❌ 573 → last digit 3 (odd) → not divisible by 2
✅ 1000 → last digit 0 (even) → divisible by 2
```

**RULE 2: Divisibility by 3**

**Rule Statement:**
A number is divisible by 3 if the **sum of all digits is divisible by 3**.

**Why It Works:**
```
Proof: Any number with digits a, b, c
N = 100a + 10b + c
  = 99a + a + 9b + b + c
  = 3(33a + 3b) + (a + b + c)
  
The first part 3(33a + 3b) is always divisible by 3
So N is divisible by 3 ⟺ (a + b + c) is divisible by 3
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ 273 → 2+7+3 = 12 → 12÷3 = 4 → divisible by 3
✅ 369 → 3+6+9 = 18 → 18÷3 = 6 → divisible by 3
❌ 275 → 2+7+5 = 14 → not divisible by 3
✅ 111 → 1+1+1 = 3 → divisible by 3
```

**RULE 3: Divisibility by 4**

**Rule Statement:**
A number is divisible by 4 if **the last 2 digits form a number divisible by 4**.

**Why It Works:**
```
N = 100a + (last 2 digits)
100a is always divisible by 4 (100 = 4×25)
So N is divisible by 4 ⟺ last 2 digits divisible by 4
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ 5004 → last 2 digits = 04 → 04÷4 = 1 → divisible by 4
✅ 3216 → last 2 digits = 16 → 16÷4 = 4 → divisible by 4
❌ 5017 → last 2 digits = 17 → not divisible by 4
✅ 3200 → last 2 digits = 00 → divisible by 4
```

**RULE 4: Divisibility by 5**

**Rule Statement:**
A number is divisible by 5 if **unit digit is 0 or 5**.

**Examples:**
```
✅ 375 → last digit 5 → divisible by 5
✅ 4680 → last digit 0 → divisible by 5
❌ 372 → last digit 2 → not divisible by 5
✅ 1000 → last digit 0 → divisible by 5
```

**RULE 5: Divisibility by 6**

**Rule Statement:**
A number is divisible by 6 if it is **divisible by BOTH 2 AND 3**.
(Since 6 = 2 × 3 and 2, 3 are coprime)

**Method:**
```
Step 1: Check if even (divisible by 2)
Step 2: Check if digit sum divisible by 3
If both YES → divisible by 6
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ 6492
  - Even? Yes (ends in 2)
  - Digit sum: 6+4+9+2 = 21 → 21÷3 = 7 ✓
  - Conclusion: Divisible by 6

❌ 5523
  - Even? No (ends in 3)
  - Conclusion: Not divisible by 6 (fails first test)

✅ 1512
  - Even? Yes (ends in 2)
  - Digit sum: 1+5+1+2 = 9 → divisible by 3 ✓
  - Conclusion: Divisible by 6
```

**RULE 6: Divisibility by 7** (Advanced)

**Rule Statement:**
Remove the last digit, double it, and subtract from the remaining number.
Repeat until you get a small number. If result is divisible by 7, original number is divisible by 7.

**Step-by-Step Process:**
```
For 10717:

Step 1: Remove 7, double it = 14. Remaining = 1071
Step 2: 1071 - 14 = 1057

Step 3: Remove 7, double it = 14. Remaining = 105  
Step 4: 105 - 14 = 91

Step 5: Remove 1, double it = 2. Remaining = 9
Step 6: 9 - 2 = 7

Final result: 7 is divisible by 7 ✓
Conclusion: 10717 is divisible by 7
```

**RULE 7: Divisibility by 8**

**Rule Statement:**
A number is divisible by 8 if **the last 3 digits form a number divisible by 8**.

**Examples:**
```
✅ 6573392 → last 3 digits = 392 → 392÷8 = 49 → divisible by 8
✅ 4000 → last 3 digits = 000 → divisible by 8
❌ 5137 → last 3 digits = 137 → not divisible by 8
```

**RULE 8: Divisibility by 9**

**Rule Statement:**
A number is divisible by 9 if the **sum of all digits is divisible by 9**.

**Why It Works:**
```
Similar to divisibility by 3, but works for 9
N = 99a + 9b + (digit sum)
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ 15606 → 1+5+6+0+6 = 18 → 18÷9 = 2 → divisible by 9
✅ 729 → 7+2+9 = 18 → divisible by 9
❌ 156 → 1+5+6 = 12 → not divisible by 9
```

**RULE 9: Divisibility by 10**

**Rule Statement:**
A number is divisible by 10 if **last digit is 0**.

**Examples:**
```
✅ 4470 → divisible by 10
✅ 1000 → divisible by 10
❌ 4475 → not divisible by 10
```

**RULE 10: Divisibility by 11** (Important)

**Rule Statement:**
A number is divisible by 11 if the **difference between sum of digits at odd positions and sum of digits at even positions is 0 or divisible by 11**.

**Method:**
```
For a number abcde (reading left to right):
Odd positions: a, c, e
Even positions: b, d

(Sum of odd) - (Sum of even) = 0 or divisible by 11
```

**Examples:**
```
✅ 9823
  Odd positions (1st, 3rd): 9, 2 → sum = 11
  Even positions (2nd, 4th): 8, 3 → sum = 11
  Difference: 11 - 11 = 0 → divisible by 11

✅ 14641
  Test alternately: 1-4+6-4+1 = 0 → divisible by 11

❌ 1234
  Odd: 1, 3 → sum = 4
  Even: 2, 4 → sum = 6
  Difference: 4 - 6 = -2 → not divisible by 11
```

### 3. Worked Examples (Day 3)

| 10 | Last digit 0 | Unit digit = 0 |
| 11 | (Odd sum) - (Even sum) ÷ 11 | Alternating sum |

### 5. Common Mistakes (Day 3)

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Checking only last digit for div. by 4 | 18 ends in 8, but not div. by 4 | Use last 2 digits (18÷4 = 4.5) |
| Confusing div. by 3 and 9 | Assuming one implies other | Both work on digit sum, but 9 is strict |
| Forgetting AND condition for 6 | Only checking if even | MUST check both div. by 2 AND 3 |
| Wrong alternating sum for 11 | Getting order wrong | Always: 1st - 2nd + 3rd - 4th... |

### 6. Interview Tips (Day 3)

💡 **Tip 1:** Memorize top 6 rules (2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10) - covers 80% of questions

## 📅 DAY 4: HCF & LCM – SHARING AND GROUPING

### 1. Real-World Scenarios Before Theory

**Scenario A: Fair Distribution (HCF)**
```
Problem: 24 chocolates and 36 cookies to distribute equally among kids,
with no remainder and maximum number of kids.

Solution: Find HCF(24, 36)
- 24 = 2³ × 3
- 36 = 2² × 3²
- HCF = 2² × 3 = 12

Answer: Can distribute among 12 kids
- Each kid gets: 24÷12 = 2 chocolates
- Each kid gets: 36÷12 = 3 cookies
```

**Scenario B: Meeting Again (LCM)**
```
Problem: Bus A arrives every 6 minutes, Bus B every 8 minutes.
When will both arrive together again?

Solution: Find LCM(6, 8)
- 6 = 2 × 3
- 8 = 2³
- LCM = 2³ × 3 = 24 minutes

Answer: After 24 minutes
```

### 2. HCF (Highest Common Factor) – Formal Definition

**Definition:**
HCF of two or more numbers is the **greatest number that divides each of them exactly** (with remainder = 0).

**Alternate Names:**
- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
- GCM (Greatest Common Measure)

**Notation:**
HCF(a, b) or GCD(a, b)

**Properties of HCF:**
1. HCF is always ≤ smallest of the given numbers
2. HCF of coprime numbers is 1
3. HCF is commutative: HCF(a, b) = HCF(b, a)
4. HCF is associative: HCF(a, HCF(b, c)) = HCF(HCF(a, b), c)

### 3. Finding HCF: Multiple Methods

**METHOD 1: Division Method (Euclidean Algorithm)**

**Process:**
```
Step 1: Divide larger by smaller
Step 2: Divide previous divisor by remainder
Step 3: Continue until remainder = 0
Step 4: Last divisor is the HCF
```

**Example: HCF(96, 348)**
```
348 ÷ 96 = 3 remainder 60
  348 = 96 × 3 + 60

96 ÷ 60 = 1 remainder 36
  96 = 60 × 1 + 36

60 ÷ 36 = 1 remainder 24
  60 = 36 × 1 + 24

36 ÷ 24 = 1 remainder 12
  36 = 24 × 1 + 12

24 ÷ 12 = 2 remainder 0
  24 = 12 × 2 + 0

Last divisor = 12
HCF(96, 348) = 12
```

**METHOD 2: Prime Factorization Method**

**Process:**
```
Step 1: Find prime factors of each number
Step 2: Take COMMON prime factors
Step 3: Use LOWEST power of each common prime
Step 4: Multiply them
```

**Example: HCF(20, 30)**
```
20 = 2² × 5¹
30 = 2¹ × 3¹ × 5¹

Common primes: 2, 5
Lowest powers: 2¹, 5¹

HCF = 2¹ × 5¹ = 10
```

**METHOD 3: Listing Common Factors**

**Process:**
```
Step 1: List all factors of each number
Step 2: Find common factors
Step 3: Take the greatest
```

**Example: HCF(12, 36)**
```
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36

Common: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
HCF = 12
```

### 4. Finding HCF of More Than Two Numbers

**Process:**
```
Step 1: Find HCF of first two numbers
Step 2: Find HCF of result and third number
Step 3: Continue for all numbers
```

**Example: HCF(120, 246, 100)**
```
Step 1: HCF(120, 246)
  246 = 120 × 2 + 6
  120 = 6 × 20 + 0
  → HCF = 6

Step 2: HCF(6, 100)
  100 = 6 × 16 + 4
  6 = 4 × 1 + 2
  4 = 2 × 2 + 0
  → HCF = 2

Final: HCF(120, 246, 100) = 2
```

### 5. LCM (Least Common Multiple) – Formal Definition

**Definition:**
LCM of two or more numbers is the **smallest number divisible by each of them exactly**.

**Notation:**
LCM(a, b) or L(a, b)

**Properties of LCM:**
1. LCM is always ≥ largest of the given numbers
2. LCM of coprime numbers = their product
3. LCM is commutative: LCM(a, b) = LCM(b, a)

### 6. Finding LCM: Multiple Methods

**METHOD 1: Prime Factorization Method**

**Process:**
```
Step 1: Find prime factors of each number
Step 2: Take ALL prime factors
Step 3: Use HIGHEST power of each prime
Step 4: Multiply them
```

**Example: LCM(4, 6)**
```
4 = 2²
6 = 2¹ × 3¹

All primes: 2, 3
Highest powers: 2², 3¹

LCM = 2² × 3 = 12
```

**METHOD 2: Division Method (Successive Division)**

**Process:**
```
Step 1: Write numbers in a line
Step 2: Divide by smallest prime that divides at least 2 numbers
Step 3: Bring down quotients and unchanged numbers
Step 4: Repeat until all numbers are coprime
Step 5: Multiply all divisors and remaining numbers
```

**Example: LCM(14, 18, 24, 30)**
```
2 | 14,  18,  24,  30
3 |  7,   9,  12,  15
  |  7,   3,   4,   5

LCM = 2 × 3 × 7 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 2520

Verification:
  2520 ÷ 14 = 180 ✓
  2520 ÷ 18 = 140 ✓
  2520 ÷ 24 = 105 ✓
  2520 ÷ 30 = 84 ✓
```

**METHOD 3: Listing Multiples Method**

**Process:**
```
Step 1: List multiples of each number
Step 2: Find common multiples
Step 3: Take the smallest
```

**Example: LCM(4, 6)**
```
Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24...
Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30...

Common: 12, 24, 36...
LCM = 12
```

### 7. THE FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP (MOST IMPORTANT)

**Golden Formula:**
```
For any two numbers a and b:

LCM(a, b) × HCF(a, b) = a × b

Or: LCM(a, b) = (a × b) / HCF(a, b)
    HCF(a, b) = (a × b) / LCM(a, b)
```

**Proof Example: a = 12, b = 18**
```
HCF(12, 18) = 6
LCM(12, 18) = 36

Product of numbers: 12 × 18 = 216
Product of HCF and LCM: 6 × 36 = 216 ✓
```

**Why This Matters:**
- If you know HCF, you can find LCM
- Only need to remember one formula
- Saves calculation time

## 📅 DAY 5: BODMAS/VBODMAS – DISCIPLINE IN CALCULATION

### 1. Why Order of Operations Matters

**Real-World Example:**
```
Situation: Calculate total bill
  Base price: ₹100
  Discount: ₹20
  Tax: 10%

Wrong order: (100 - 20 + 10) = 90 (adds tax as absolute value)
Correct order: ((100 - 20) × 1.10) = 88 (applies tax percentage)

Difference: ₹2 error!
```

**Mathematical Example:**
```
Problem: 6 + 2 × 3 = ?

Wrong: (6 + 2) × 3 = 8 × 3 = 24
Correct: 6 + (2 × 3) = 6 + 6 = 12

Multiplication has higher precedence than addition!
```

### 2. BODMAS/VBODMAS Order (Complete Definition)

**BODMAS Acronym:**
```
B - Brackets       (first)
O - Orders         (second - powers, roots)
D - Division       (third)
M - Multiplication (third - same level as division)
A - Addition       (fourth)
S - Subtraction    (fourth - same level as addition)
```

**VBODMAS Acronym (Alternative):**
```
V - Vinculum       (bar/line over expression)
B - Brackets
O - Orders
D - Division
M - Multiplication
A - Addition
S - Subtraction
```

**Key Points:**
1. **Division and Multiplication have SAME precedence** → solve LEFT TO RIGHT
2. **Addition and Subtraction have SAME precedence** → solve LEFT TO RIGHT
3. **Always work inside brackets first**
4. **Calculate powers/roots (Orders) before multiplication/division**

### 3. Bracket Types (VBODMAS Detail)

**Type 1: Round Brackets () - Solve First**
```
Example: 3 + (2 × 4) = 3 + 8 = 11
```

**Type 2: Square Brackets [] - Solve Second**
```
Example: 2 × [3 + (4 × 2)] 
        = 2 × [3 + 8]
        = 2 × 11
        = 22
```

**Type 3: Curly Brackets {} - Solve Third**
```
Example: 5 + {2 × [3 + (1 + 2)]}
        = 5 + {2 × [3 + 3]}
        = 5 + {2 × 6}
        = 5 + 12
        = 17
```

**Type 4: Vinculum (Bar/Line) - Highest Priority**
```
Example: 8 + 6
         ───  (treat as one unit)
         2 + 2

Solve top and bottom SEPARATELY:
= (8 + 6) / (2 + 2)
= 14 / 4
= 3.5
```

## 📅 PERCENTAGE BASICS – PERFECT BRIDGE TO WEEK 2

**Duration:** Day 5 Extra (30 min) | **Level:** Beginner → Expert | **Why Added?** Week 2 Percentages foundation

### 1. WHAT IS PERCENTAGE? (Super Simple Start 😊)

**Percentage = "Per Hundred"** (per 100)

```
Pizza Example 🍕:
Whole pizza = 100%
8 slices = 100%
1 slice = 1/8 = 12.5%

Money Example 💰:
Whole amount = 100%
₹50 out of ₹100 = 50%
₹25 out of ₹100 = 25%
```

**Magic Formula (Memorize This!):**
```
Percentage = (Part ÷ Whole) × 100%

Example:
8 marks out of 10
= (8 ÷ 10) × 100
= 0.8 × 100
= 80%
```

### 2. PERCENTAGE = RATIO × 100

**Simple Understanding:**

```
Ratio: 1 out of 2 = 1/2
Decimal: 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5
Percentage: 0.5 × 100 = 50%

Why 100? Because percentage means "per hundred"
Easier to think: Out of 100, how many?
```

**Real Examples:**

```
Example A: Class Test
Q: Scored 18 out of 20. What %?
Answer: (18÷20) × 100 = 90%
Meaning: If out of 100, would score 90

Example B: Discount
Q: ₹300 discount on ₹1000 item. What %?
Answer: (300÷1000) × 100 = 30%
Meaning: 30 out of 100 rupees are discount

Example C: Success Rate
Q: 45 people selected out of 150. What %?
Answer: (45÷150) × 100 = 30%
Meaning: 30 out of 100 people are selected
```

### 3. THREE WAYS TO EXPRESS SAME THING

**Percentage, Decimal, Fraction**

```
50% = 0.50 = 1/2
25% = 0.25 = 1/4
20% = 0.20 = 1/5
10% = 0.10 = 1/10
33.33% = 0.3333... = 1/3
75% = 0.75 = 3/4
100% = 1.00 = 1/1 (whole)
200% = 2.00 = 2/1 (double)
```

**Quick Conversion:**

```
% to Decimal: Divide by 100
25% → 25÷100 = 0.25

Decimal to %: Multiply by 100
0.35 → 0.35×100 = 35%

Fraction to %: (Top÷Bottom) × 100
3/4 → (3÷4)×100 = 75%

% to Fraction: Put over 100, simplify
25% → 25/100 = 1/4
```

### 4. FOUR EASY PERCENTAGE TRICKS (Beginner Level)

**Trick 1: Find 10%** (Easiest!)

```
Move decimal 1 place LEFT

10% of 750 = 75
10% of 8000 = 800
10% of 45 = 4.5

Why? Because 10/100 = 1/10
Dividing by 10 = move decimal left
```

**Trick 2: Find 50%** (Half)

```
Divide by 2

50% of 100 = 50
50% of 200 = 100
50% of 750 = 375

Why? 50% = 1/2 = divide by 2
```

**Trick 3: Find 25%** (Quarter)

```
Divide by 4

25% of 100 = 25
25% of 400 = 100
25% of 800 = 200

Why? 25% = 1/4 = divide by 4
```

**Trick 4: Find 5%** (Half of 10%)

```
Find 10%, then divide by 2

5% of 200 = ?
Step 1: 10% of 200 = 20
Step 2: 20 ÷ 2 = 10
Answer: 5% of 200 = 10
```

### 5. PERCENTAGE INCREASE & DECREASE

**Real Life: Salary Increase**

```
Original Salary: ₹30,000
Increase: ₹3,000
% Increase = (Increase ÷ Original) × 100
           = (3000 ÷ 30000) × 100
           = 10%

Meaning: 10 rupees increase for every 100 rupees original
```

**Real Life: Weight Loss**

```
Original Weight: 80 kg
Loss: 5 kg
% Loss = (Loss ÷ Original) × 100
       = (5 ÷ 80) × 100
       = 6.25%

Meaning: Lost 6.25 kg per 100 kg original
```

**Formula (Most Important):**

```
% Increase = [(New - Original) ÷ Original] × 100
% Decrease = [(Original - New) ÷ Original] × 100

KEY: Always divide by ORIGINAL (starting value)!
```

### 6. FINDING ACTUAL VALUE FROM PERCENTAGE

**Problem Type 1: Part from Percentage**

```
Q: 20% of ₹500 = ?

Solution:
20% = 20/100 = 0.20
20% of 500 = 0.20 × 500 = 100

Answer: ₹100
```

**Problem Type 2: Whole from Percentage**

```
Q: 25% of X = 75. Find X.

Solution:
25% of X = 75
(25/100) × X = 75
0.25 × X = 75
X = 75 ÷ 0.25
X = 300

Answer: X = 300
```

**Problem Type 3: Increase/Decrease Amount**

```
Q: ₹500 increased by 10%. New amount?

Solution:
Increase = 10% of 500 = 0.10 × 500 = 50
New amount = 500 + 50 = 550

OR Direct:
New = 100% + 10% = 110% of original
    = 1.10 × 500
    = 550
```

### 7. WORKED EXAMPLES - PERCENTAGE (Beginner → Expert)

**Easy Level**

**Ex 1: Basic Percentage**
```
Q: 12 out of 50 students passed. What %?

Solution:
Percentage = (12÷50) × 100
           = 0.24 × 100
           = 24%

Answer: 24% students passed
```

**Ex 2: Finding Part**
```
Q: 30% of 200 chocolates = ?

Solution:
30% = 30/100
30% of 200 = (30/100) × 200
           = 0.30 × 200
           = 60

Answer: 60 chocolates
```

**Medium Level**

**Ex 3: Percentage Increase**
```
Q: Price ₹400 → ₹480. % increase?

Solution:
Increase = 480 - 400 = 80
% Increase = (80÷400) × 100
           = 0.20 × 100
           = 20%

Answer: 20% increase
```

**Ex 4: Discount Calculation**
```
Q: ₹1000 item with 20% discount. Final price?

Solution:
Discount = 20% of 1000 = 0.20 × 1000 = 200
Final = 1000 - 200 = 800

OR:
Final = (100% - 20%) of 1000
      = 80% of 1000
      = 0.80 × 1000
      = 800

Answer: ₹800
```

**Expert Level**

**Ex 5: Finding Original from Decreased Value**
```
Q: After 25% off, shirt costs ₹600. Original price?

Solution:
After 25% off = 75% of original
75% of X = 600
0.75 × X = 600
X = 600 ÷ 0.75
X = 800

Answer: Original ₹800
```

**Ex 6: Successive Percentages (Trap!)** ⚠️

```
Q: 10% increase, then 20% increase. Total % increase?

WRONG: 10% + 20% = 30%
CORRECT: Calculate step by step

Original = 100
After 10% increase: 100 × 1.10 = 110
After 20% increase: 110 × 1.20 = 132

Total % = ((132 - 100) ÷ 100) × 100
        = (32 ÷ 100) × 100
        = 32%

Answer: 32% (NOT 30%!)
```

### 8. COMMON PERCENTAGE MISTAKES

| Mistake | Why Wrong | Correct |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Forget to multiply by 100 | (25/100) = 0.25, not 25% | (25÷100)×100 = 25% |
| Use new value as base | 80→100 is (20÷100)×100=20% | Use original: (20÷80)×100=25% |
| Add successive % | 10% then 20% = 30% | 1.10×1.20-1 = 32% (compound) |
| Treat % as number | 20% of 100 = 20×100 | 0.20×100 = 20 |
| Forget % base | Increase from 20 to 25 is "5" | But % = (5÷20)×100 = 25% |
