# 📅 DAY 1 (MONDAY): RATIO FOUNDATIONS

## 🎯 TODAY'S LEARNING OBJECTIVE

By end of today, you will:
- ✅ Understand ratio as RELATIONSHIP, not just numbers
- ✅ Know WHY ratios were invented
- ✅ Master ratio simplification
- ✅ Solve three-part distribution problems
- ✅ Connect ratio to real partnerships

---

## PART 1: HISTORICAL & FOUNDATIONAL CONTEXT

### Why Ratio Was Invented (Historical Context)

**Ancient Problem (3000 BCE):**

```
Babylonian merchants needed to trade:
- 5 measures of grain ↔ 2 measures of gold
- But how to trade with strangers?
- How to verify fairness?

Without ratio:
"I'm giving 100 measures of grain for 40 measures of gold"
Is this fair? Unknown!

With ratio:
"This trade maintains 5:2 ratio"
Both can verify fairness by checking same ratio

Why this works:
5 : 2 = 100 : 40
If ratio maintained → trade is fair
```

**Why ratio matters today:**
- Fair trade across different quantities
- Scaling recipes, maps, architectural plans
- Understanding relationships (not just numbers)
- Business partnerships (who gets what share)

---

## PART 2: DEEP DEFINITION OF RATIO

### Three Levels of Understanding

**Level 1 (Formal Mathematical):**
Ratio is an ordered pair of quantities (a, b), often expressed as a:b, representing the relationship a/b.

**Level 2 (Conceptual):**
Ratio is a proportional relationship showing "for every a units of one thing, there are b units of another."

**Level 3 (Practical):**
Ratio is a tool to compare things of different sizes by finding their proportional relationship, which remains constant even when quantities change.

### Why Each Definition Matters

```
Definition 1 (Formal): Helps with mathematical operations
Definition 2 (Conceptual): Helps understand real-world meaning  
Definition 3 (Practical): Helps solve actual problems
```

---

## PART 3: RATIO TYPES

### Type 1: Part-to-Part Ratio

**Definition:** Comparing two different parts of the same whole

```
Example: In a class of 30 students:
- 18 boys, 12 girls
- Boys:Girls = 18:12 = 3:2

This means: For every 3 boys, there are 2 girls
```

---

### Type 2: Part-to-Whole Ratio

**Definition:** Comparing one part to the entire whole

```
Example: In a class of 30 students with 18 boys:
Boys:Class = 18:30 = 3:5

Meaning:
- Boys are 3/5 of the class
- Boys are (3/5) × 100 = 60% of class

Connection to percentages from Week 2!
```

---

## PART 4: WORKED EXAMPLES (DAY 1)

### Example 1.1: Simple Ratio Simplification

```
Q: Simplify 48:64:80

Solution:
Method 1 - GCD approach:
Find GCD(48, 64, 80) = 16
48:64:80 = (48÷16):(64÷16):(80÷16) = 3:4:5

Verification:
3 × 16 = 48 ✓
4 × 16 = 64 ✓
5 × 16 = 80 ✓

Why simplify?
Easier to visualize and work with!
3:4:5 is cleaner than 48:64:80
```

---

### Example 1.2: Three-Part Distribution

```
Q: Income divided A:B:C = 2:3:4
   Total income = ₹27,000
   Find each person's share

Solution:
Step 1: Find total parts
Total parts = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9

Step 2: Find value of one part
One part = 27,000 / 9 = ₹3,000

Step 3: Calculate shares
A's share = 2 × 3,000 = ₹6,000
B's share = 3 × 3,000 = ₹9,000
C's share = 4 × 3,000 = ₹12,000

Verification:
6,000 + 9,000 + 12,000 = 27,000 ✓
6,000:9,000:12,000 = 2:3:4 ✓

Real-world application:
Three partners invest in business
Profits distributed proportionally to investment ratio
```

---

### Example 1.3: Ratio with Change (Age Problem)

```
Q: Present age of A:B = 3:4
   In 5 years, ratio becomes 4:5
   Find current ages

Solution:
Let A = 3x, B = 4x (current ages)

In 5 years:
A's age = 3x + 5
B's age = 4x + 5

New ratio:
(3x + 5):(4x + 5) = 4:5

Cross multiply:
5(3x + 5) = 4(4x + 5)
15x + 25 = 16x + 20
25 - 20 = 16x - 15x
5 = x

Current ages:
A = 3 × 5 = 15 years
B = 4 × 5 = 20 years

Verification:
Current: 15:20 = 3:4 ✓
In 5 years: 20:25 = 4:5 ✓

Interview insight:
Shows algebraic thinking with ratios
```

---

### Example 1.4: Equivalent Ratios (Scaling)

```
Q: Recipe for 2 people: flour 200g, sugar 300g
   How much for 8 people?

Solution:
Step 1: Identify ratio
Flour:Sugar = 200:300 = 2:3

Step 2: Scale factor
For 2 people → 8 people = 8/2 = 4 times

Step 3: Scale ingredients
Flour needed = 200 × 4 = 800g
Sugar needed = 300 × 4 = 1,200g

Verification:
New ratio 800:1,200 = 2:3 ✓ (ratio maintained)

Why this works:
Ratio flour:sugar = 2:3 always
Just scaling up the total by 4
```

---

### Example 1.5: Part-to-Part vs Part-to-Whole

```
Q: Boys:Girls = 3:4 in a school
   What percentage are boys?

Solution:
WRONG approach:
"Boys are 3%, girls are 4%"

CORRECT approach:
Total = 3 + 4 = 7 parts
Boys = 3/7 of total = (3/7) × 100 = 42.86%
Girls = 4/7 of total = (4/7) × 100 = 57.14%

Why the difference?
3:4 is part-to-part (boys compared to girls)
But question asks part-to-whole (boys of total)

Must add denominator!
```

---

### Example 1.6: Simplifying Before Solving

```
Q: Gold:Silver = 150:250. If total = 80 grams, find each.

Solution:
Method 1 (Without simplifying):
Total parts = 150 + 250 = 400
Per part = 80/400 = 0.2 grams
Gold = 150 × 0.2 = 30 grams
Silver = 250 × 0.2 = 50 grams

Method 2 (WITH simplifying - BETTER):
Simplify: 150:250 = 3:5
Total parts = 3 + 5 = 8
Per part = 80/8 = 10 grams
Gold = 3 × 10 = 30 grams
Silver = 5 × 10 = 50 grams

Result is same, but Method 2 is cleaner!
Always simplify first.
```

---

## PART 5: COMMON MISTAKES (DAY 1)

### Mistake 1: Treating Ratio as Absolute Number

**Student Error:**
"Ratio A:B = 2:3, so A is 2 items and B is 3 items"

**Why Wrong:**
Ratio is relationship, not quantity!

**Prevention:**
"Ratio 2:3 means for every 2 units of A, there are 3 units of B"

---

### Mistake 2: Not Simplifying the Ratio

**Student Error:**
"Ratio is 100:150, so each gets 100 and 150"

**Prevention:**
Always simplify ratio to lowest terms first!

---

### Mistake 3: Mixing Part-to-Part and Part-to-Whole

**Student Error:**
"Boys:Girls = 3:4, so girls are 4% of school"

**Prevention:**
Girls are 4/(3+4) = 4/7 ≈ 57.14% of school

---

## PART 6: INTERVIEW TIPS (DAY 1)

💡 **Tip 1: Always simplify ratios first**
"Let me simplify 48:64:80 to 3:4:5"
Shows systematic thinking

💡 **Tip 2: State what ratio TYPE you're using**
"This is a part-to-part ratio of boys to girls"
Shows clear understanding

💡 **Tip 3: Use clear language when explaining**
"For every 2 units of A, there are 3 units of B"
Better than just "ratio is 2:3"

💡 **Tip 4: Verify by checking the ratio**
"Let me confirm: 6,000:9,000:12,000 = 2:3:4 ✓"
Shows verification habit

---

## PART 7: PRACTICE QUESTIONS (DAY 1)

**Q1.1:** Simplify 72:96:108
**Solution:** GCD = 12, Answer: 6:8:9

**Q1.2:** If A:B = 3:5 and A = 24, find B

By end of today, you will:
- ✅ Master compound ratios (3+ quantities)
- ✅ Understand ratio in real partnerships
- ✅ Solve complex distribution problems
- ✅ Connect ratios to percentages
- ✅ Handle real-world business scenarios

---

## PART 1: COMPOUND RATIOS (THREE OR MORE QUANTITIES)

### The Challenge with Multiple Quantities

```
Problem:
A:B = 3:4
B:C = 2:5

Find A:B:C = ?

Challenge: B has different values (4 in first, 2 in second)
Solution: Make B equal using LCM
```

---

## PART 2: COMPOUND RATIO SOLUTION METHOD

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Identify the common quantity**
In this case, B appears in both ratios

**Step 2: Find LCM of B values**
B = 4 in first ratio
B = 2 in second ratio
LCM(4, 2) = 4

**Step 3: Scale ratios to make B equal**
First ratio A:B = 3:4 (already has B=4) ✓
Second ratio B:C = 2:5 (need B=4, so multiply by 2)
→ B:C = 4:10

**Step 4: Combine all three**
A:B:C = 3:4:10

**Verification:**
- A:B = 3:4 ✓
- B:C = 4:10 = 2:5 ✓

---

## PART 3: WORKED EXAMPLES (DAY 2)

### Example 2.1: Compound Ratio - Simple

```
Q: A:B = 2:3, B:C = 4:5. Find A:B:C

Solution:
B values: 3 and 4
LCM(3, 4) = 12

Scale first ratio by 4: A:B = 2:3 → 8:12
Scale second ratio by 3: B:C = 4:5 → 12:15

Result: A:B:C = 8:12:15

Verification:
A:B = 8:12 = 2:3 ✓
B:C = 12:15 = 4:5 ✓
```

---

### Example 2.2: Partnership with Different Investments

```
Q: Two partners invest:
Partner A: ₹50,000
Partner B: ₹75,000

They agree to share profit in ratio of investment
If profit = ₹12,500:
Find each person's profit share

Solution:
Investment ratio = 50,000 : 75,000

Simplify:
Divide both by 25,000
= 2:3

Total parts = 2 + 3 = 5

A's share = (2/5) × 12,500 = ₹5,000
B's share = (3/5) × 12,500 = ₹7,500

Verification:
5,000 + 7,500 = 12,500 ✓
5,000 : 7,500 = 2:3 ✓

Business insight:
A invested 40%, gets 40% profit
B invested 60%, gets 60% profit
Fair and proportional!
```

---

### Example 2.3: Three-Partner Distribution

```
Q: Business profit ₹60,000 split among A, B, C
   Based on investment ratio 5:4:6

Find each person's share

Solution:
Total parts = 5 + 4 + 6 = 15
Per part = 60,000 / 15 = 4,000

A's share = 5 × 4,000 = ₹20,000
B's share = 4 × 4,000 = ₹16,000
C's share = 6 × 4,000 = ₹24,000

Verification:
20,000 + 16,000 + 24,000 = 60,000 ✓
20,000:16,000:24,000 = 5:4:6 ✓

As percentages:
A = 33.33%, B = 26.67%, C = 40%
```

---

### Example 2.4: Ratio with Ages and Time

```
Q: Ages of A:B = 4:5
   In 3 years, ratio becomes 5:6
   Find current ages

Solution:
Let A = 4x, B = 5x

In 3 years:
A's age = 4x + 3
B's age = 5x + 3

New ratio:
(4x + 3) : (5x + 3) = 5:6

Cross multiply:
6(4x + 3) = 5(5x + 3)
24x + 18 = 25x + 15
18 - 15 = 25x - 24x
3 = x

Current ages:
A = 4 × 3 = 12 years
B = 5 × 3 = 15 years

Verification:
Current: 12:15 = 4:5 ✓
In 3 years: 15:18 = 5:6 ✓
```

---

### Example 2.5: Ratio to Percentage Conversion

```
Q: In a class, boys:girls = 3:5
   What percentage are boys and girls?

Solution:
Total parts = 3 + 5 = 8

Boys percentage = (3/8) × 100 = 37.5%
Girls percentage = (5/8) × 100 = 62.5%

Verification:
37.5% + 62.5% = 100% ✓

Week 2 connection:
Ratio and percentages are connected!
Ratio shows relationship
Percentage shows relative size
```

---

### Example 2.6: Four-Quantity Continued Ratio

```
Q: A:B = 2:3, B:C = 3:4, C:D = 4:5
   Find A:B:C:D

Solution:
A:B = 2:3
B:C = 3:4 (B already matches!)
C:D = 4:5 (C needs adjustment)

Make C consistent:
From B:C = 3:4, we have C = 4 units (when B = 3)
From C:D = 4:5, we have C = 4 units (when D = 5)
They already match!

So: A:B = 2:3
    B:C = 3:4
    C:D = 4:5

Combine step by step:
A:B:C = 2:3:4
Then add D where C:D = 4:5
A:B:C:D = 2:3:4:5

Verification:
A:B = 2:3 ✓
B:C = 3:4 ✓
C:D = 4:5 ✓
A:D = 2:5 ✓
```

---

### Example 2.7: Supply Chain Ratio

```
Q: In a supply chain:
Supplier to Producer = 1:3
Producer to Retailer = 2:5

If retailer sells 100 items for ₹5,000
Find each stakeholder's revenue

Solution:
Make Producer equal:
Supplier:Producer = 1:3 (Producer = 3)
Producer:Retailer = 2:5 (Producer = 2)

LCM(3, 2) = 6

Supplier:Producer = 1:3 → multiply by 2 → 2:6
Producer:Retailer = 2:5 → multiply by 3 → 6:15

Combined: Supplier:Producer:Retailer = 2:6:15

Total parts = 2 + 6 + 15 = 23
Per part = 5,000 / 23 = ₹217.39

Supplier gets: 2 × 217.39 = ₹434.78
Producer gets: 6 × 217.39 = ₹1,304.35
Retailer gets: 15 × 217.39 = ₹3,260.87

Verification:
434.78 + 1,304.35 + 3,260.87 = 5,000 ✓

Interpretation:
Retailer makes 75% of revenue
Producer makes 26% 
Supplier makes only 8.7%
This shows why distribution is important!
```

---

### Example 2.8: Marble Problem with Change

```
Q: A bag contains red and blue marbles in ratio 3:2
   After adding 20 red marbles, ratio becomes 5:2
   How many marbles were initially?

Solution:
Let initial red = 3x, blue = 2x

After adding 20 red:
(3x + 20) : 2x = 5:2

Cross multiply:
2(3x + 20) = 5(2x)
6x + 40 = 10x
40 = 4x
x = 10

Initial marbles:
Red = 3 × 10 = 30
Blue = 2 × 10 = 20
Total = 50 marbles

Verification:
Initial: 30:20 = 3:2 ✓
After: 50:20 = 5:2 ✓
```

---

## PART 4: COMMON MISTAKES (DAY 2)

# 📅 DAY 3 (WEDNESDAY): PROPORTION & ADVANCED APPLICATIONS

## 🎯 TODAY'S LEARNING OBJECTIVE

By end of today, you will:
- ✅ Master direct and inverse proportion
- ✅ Understand compound proportions
- ✅ Apply alligation method (mixing problems)
- ✅ Solve geometry proportion problems
- ✅ Apply to real-world concentration problems

---

## PART 1: DIRECT PROPORTION MASTERY

### Definition
If y = kx (where k is constant), then y is directly proportional to x

### How to Identify
- As x increases, y increases
- Ratio y/x always constant
- Graph is straight line through origin

### Real Applications

```
1. Total Cost = Price per unit × Quantity
2. Distance = Speed × Time (at constant speed)
3. Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time
4. Work done = Rate × Time
```

---

### Example 3.1: Direct Proportion - Simple Interest

```
Q: Simple Interest formula: SI = P × R × T / 100
   Principal ₹5,000, Rate 8% per year
   
   Make table for SI vs Time
   Find constant of proportionality

Solution:
k = P × R / 100 = 5,000 × 8 / 100 = 400

SI = 400 × T

Time (years) | SI (₹)
1            | 400
2            | 800
3            | 1,200
4            | 1,600

This is direct proportion: SI ∝ T
Constant k = ₹400 per year

Interpretation:
Every year adds ₹400 interest
Relationship is linear (straight line)
```

---

## PART 2: INVERSE PROPORTION MASTERY

### Definition
If xy = k (or y = k/x), then y is inversely proportional to x

### How to Identify
- As x increases, y decreases
- Product xy always constant
- Graph is hyperbola curve

### Real Applications

```
1. Speed × Time = Distance (constant)
2. Number of Workers × Days = Work (constant)
3. Pressure × Volume = Constant (gas)
4. Cost per item × Quantity = Budget (fixed)
```

---

### Example 3.2: Inverse Proportion - Workers & Days

```
Q: 12 workers complete job in 20 days
   How many days for 15 workers?

Solution:
Workers × Days = Constant

Initial: 12 × 20 = 240 worker-days

For 15 workers:
15 × d = 240
d = 240/15 = 16 days

This is inverse proportion: Days = 240 / Workers

Interpretation:
More workers → fewer days needed
More workers → less time
Inverse relationship
```

---

## PART 3: COMPOUND PROPORTION

### Definition
Multiple quantities in direct/inverse relation simultaneously

### Example 3.3: Compound Proportion - Road Building

```
Q: 6 workers working 8 hours/day complete 120m road in 10 days
   How many days for 8 workers working 10 hours/day to complete 180m?

Solution:
Work done ∝ Workers × Hours/day × Days
120 = 6 × 8 × 10 × k
120 = 480k
k = 0.25 (efficiency factor)

For new scenario:
180 = 8 × 10 × d × 0.25
180 = 20d
d = 9 days

Verification:
Original: 6 × 8 × 10 = 480 worker-hours for 120m
New: 8 × 10 × 9 = 720 worker-hours for 180m
Ratio: 720/480 = 1.5 and 180/120 = 1.5 ✓

This is compound proportion!
```

---

## PART 4: ALLIGATION METHOD (MIXING PROBLEMS)

### What is Alligation?
Technique to find ratio when mixing items at different rates

### Example 3.4: Sugar Mixing

```
Q: Sugar at ₹20/kg and ₹30/kg to make mixture at ₹24/kg
   Ratio required?

Solution (Alligation Method):
Set up:
                20      30
                  \    /
              Avg = 24
                  /    \
              (30-24)  (24-20)
                 =6       =4

Interpretation:
(30 - 24) = 6 means take 6 parts of cheaper (20/kg)
(24 - 20) = 4 means take 4 parts of expensive (30/kg)

Ratio = 6:4 = 3:2

Verification:
(20 × 3 + 30 × 2) / (3 + 2) = (60 + 60) / 5 = 24 ✓

Answer: Mix 3 kg of ₹20/kg with 2 kg of ₹30/kg
```

---

## PART 5: GEOMETRY PROPORTION - SIMILAR TRIANGLES

### Example 3.5: Similar Triangles

```
Q: Triangle ABC is similar to Triangle DEF (scale 2:3)
   If AB = 8 cm, BC = 10 cm, CA = 12 cm
   Find sides of DEF

Solution:
Scale factor = 2:3 (DEF is 1.5 times larger)

DE = 8 × (3/2) = 12 cm
EF = 10 × (3/2) = 15 cm
FD = 12 × (3/2) = 18 cm

Verification:
AB:DE = 8:12 = 2:3 ✓
BC:EF = 10:15 = 2:3 ✓
CA:FD = 12:18 = 2:3 ✓

Perimeter ABC = 8 + 10 + 12 = 30 cm
Perimeter DEF = 12 + 15 + 18 = 45 cm
Ratio = 30:45 = 2:3 ✓
```

## PART 6: MORE WORKED EXAMPLES (DAY 3)

### Example 3.6: Concentration Problem

```
Q: Concentrate solution has 40% salt
   Need 500L of 25% salt solution
   How much concentrate and water?

Solution:
Let x = liters of concentrate

Salt content must be equal:
40% of x = 25% of 500
0.4x = 0.25 × 500
0.4x = 125
x = 312.5 L concentrate

Water needed = 500 - 312.5 = 187.5 L

Verification:
Salt in final = 0.4 × 312.5 = 125 L
Concentration = 125/500 = 25% ✓

This is proportion in chemistry context!
```

---

### Example 3.7: Three-Quantity Mixture

```
Q: Three liquids mixed:
A: 40 L at ₹50/L
B: 30 L at ₹70/L
C: 30 L at ₹60/L

Average cost per liter?

Solution:
Total cost = 40×50 + 30×70 + 30×60
          = 2,000 + 2,100 + 1,800
          = 5,900

Total volume = 40 + 30 + 30 = 100 L

Average cost = 5,900 / 100 = ₹59 per liter

This is weighted average using proportions!
```

---

### Example 3.8: Exchange Rate Proportion

```
Q: 1 USD = ₹82 INR
   How many INR for 500 USD?

Solution:
This is direct proportion

USD : INR = 1 : 82

For 500 USD:
1 : 82 = 500 : x
x = 500 × 82 = ₹41,000

Or using proportion formula:
1/82 = 500/x
x = 500 × 82 = ₹41,000

This is simple direct proportion
```

## PART 7: COMMON MISTAKES (DAY 3)

### Mistake 1: Confusing Ratio and Proportion

**Error:**
Using ratio formula for proportion problem

**Prevention:**
Ratio = relationship (5:7)
Proportion = equation (5/7 = x/20)

---

### Mistake 2: Wrong Direction in Inverse Proportion

**Error:**
"More workers, more days needed"

**Prevention:**
Inverse means opposite direction
More workers → FEWER days

# 📅 DAY 4 (THURSDAY): TIME/WORK – BASIC CONCEPTS

## 🎯 TODAY'S LEARNING OBJECTIVE

By end of today, you will:
- ✅ Understand work as fraction of job completed
- ✅ Calculate work rates (1/days)
- ✅ Combine multiple workers efficiently
- ✅ Solve basic time/work problems
- ✅ Handle work remaining scenarios

---

## PART 1: HISTORICAL & FOUNDATIONAL CONTEXT

### Why Time/Work Problems Exist

**Ancient Labor Example:**

```
Ancient kings needed to know:
- How long to build a pyramid?
- How many workers needed?
- What if some workers quit?
- How to estimate project timelines?

Modern applications:
- Software projects: How long will it take?
- Construction: When will it finish?
- Service industry: How many staff needed?
- Manufacturing: Production scheduling

Time/Work is about EFFICIENCY and CAPACITY
```

---

## PART 2: DEEP CONCEPT - WORK AS PROPORTION

### Key Insight

**Work is NOT measured in units, but in "fraction of job completed"**

```
If worker completes job in 6 days:
Worker's rate = 1/6 job per day

In 2 days: completes 2 × (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3 of job
In 6 days: completes 6 × (1/6) = 1 whole job (100%)
In 3 days: completes 3 × (1/6) = 3/6 = 1/2 of job

Think of it like this:
Job = 100 units
Worker's rate = 100/6 = 16.67 units per day
In 3 days: 3 × 16.67 = 50 units (half the job)
```

---

## PART 3: BASIC TIME/WORK FORMULAS

### Formula 1: Single Worker

```
If worker completes job in d days:
Rate = 1/d job per day
Work in t days = t × (1/d) = t/d of job
```

### Formula 2: Multiple Workers (Combined Rate)

```
If A's rate = 1/a and B's rate = 1/b:
Combined rate = 1/a + 1/b

Time for both together:
t = 1 / (combined rate)
```

---

## PART 4: WORKED EXAMPLES (DAY 4)

### Example 4.1: Single Worker - Basic

```
Q: A can complete job in 12 days
   How much work in 5 days?
   How many days to complete 3/4 of job?

Solution:
A's rate = 1/12 job per day

Part 1: In 5 days
Work = 5 × (1/12) = 5/12 of job

Part 2: For 3/4 of job
Time = (3/4) / (1/12) = (3/4) × 12 = 9 days

Verification:
In 9 days: 9 × (1/12) = 9/12 = 3/4 ✓
```

---

### Example 4.2: Two Workers - Combined

```
Q: A completes job in 6 days, B in 8 days
   Working together, how many days?

Solution:
A's rate = 1/6 per day
B's rate = 1/8 per day

Combined = 1/6 + 1/8

LCM(6, 8) = 24
= 4/24 + 3/24 = 7/24 per day

Days needed = 1 / (7/24) = 24/7 ≈ 3.43 days

Verification:
In 24/7 days:
A's work: (24/7) × (1/6) = 24/42 = 4/7
B's work: (24/7) × (1/8) = 24/56 = 3/7
Total: 4/7 + 3/7 = 7/7 = 1 ✓
```

---

### Example 4.3: Two Workers - Partial Work

```
Q: A alone takes 12 days, B alone takes 15 days.
   A works 2 days then quits, B continues.
   Total time to complete?

Solution:
A's rate = 1/12, B's rate = 1/15

Part 1: A works 2 days
Work = 2 × (1/12) = 2/12 = 1/6 of job

Remaining: 1 - 1/6 = 5/6 of job

Part 2: B completes remaining 5/6
Time = (5/6) / (1/15) = (5/6) × 15 = 75/6 = 12.5 days

Total time = 2 + 12.5 = 14.5 days

Verification:
A's work: 1/6
B's work: 12.5 × (1/15) = 12.5/15 = 5/6
Total: 1/6 + 5/6 = 1 ✓
```

---

### Example 4.4: Three Workers Together

```
Q: A (10 days), B (12 days), C (15 days) work together
   How many days to complete?

Solution:
A's rate = 1/10
B's rate = 1/12
C's rate = 1/15

Combined = 1/10 + 1/12 + 1/15

LCM(10, 12, 15) = 60
= 6/60 + 5/60 + 4/60 = 15/60 = 1/4 per day

Days = 1 / (1/4) = 4 days

Verification:
In 4 days:
A: 4 × (1/10) = 4/10
B: 4 × (1/12) = 4/12
C: 4 × (1/15) = 4/15

Total: 4/10 + 4/12 + 4/15
= 24/60 + 20/60 + 16/60 = 60/60 = 1 ✓
```

---

### Example 4.5: Finding Unknown Rate

```
Q: A and B together complete in 6 days
   A alone completes in 9 days
   B alone completes in how many days?

Solution:
Combined rate = 1/6
A's rate = 1/9
B's rate = ?

Combined = A's rate + B's rate
1/6 = 1/9 + B's rate

B's rate = 1/6 - 1/9
LCM(6, 9) = 18
= 3/18 - 2/18 = 1/18

B alone = 18 days

Verification:
Together: 1/9 + 1/18 = 2/18 + 1/18 = 3/18 = 1/6 ✓
```

---

### Example 4.6: Work Variation Problem

```
Q: A does 1/4 of job in 2 days
   How long for entire job?

Solution:
If 1/4 takes 2 days:
Entire (4/4) takes 2 × 4 = 8 days

A's rate = 1/8 per day

Verification:
Work in 8 days: 8 × (1/8) = 1 ✓
Work in 2 days: 2 × (1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4 ✓
```

---

### Example 4.7: Two Workers with Different Contributions

```
Q: A and B together complete 2/3 of job in 10 days
   If C joins, all three complete remaining 1/3 in 3 days (adjusted)
   
   Given: A + B's rate for 2/3 job in 10 days
   Find: C's rate and days alone

Solution:
Part 1: A + B's rate
(A+B) completes 2/3 in 10 days
(A+B)'s rate = (2/3) / 10 = 2/30 = 1/15 per day

Part 2: A + B + C's rate
(A+B+C) completes 1/3 in 3 days
(A+B+C)'s rate = (1/3) / 3 = 1/9 per day

C's rate = 1/9 - 1/15 = 5/45 - 3/45 = 2/45
C alone = 45/2 = 22.5 days

Verification:
In 3 days: 3 × (1/9) = 3/9 = 1/3 ✓
```

---

### Example 4.8: Work With Efficiency Ratio

```
Q: A is twice as efficient as B
   A alone completes in 10 days
   If both work together, how long?

Solution:
A's efficiency = 2 × B's efficiency
A's rate = 2 × B's rate

Let B's rate = r
A's rate = 2r

A alone takes 10 days:
1 / (2r) = 10
2r = 1/10
r = 1/20

B's rate = 1/20, so B alone takes 20 days

Combined = 2r + r = 3r = 3(1/20) = 3/20 per day
Days = 1 / (3/20) = 20/3 ≈ 6.67 days

Verification:
A's rate: 1/10
B's rate: 1/20
Combined: 1/10 + 1/20 = 2/20 + 1/20 = 3/20
Days: 20/3 ✓
```

---

## PART 5: COMMON MISTAKES (DAY 4)

### Mistake 1: Confusing Days and Work Units

**Error:**
"If A completes in 10 days and B in 15 days, together = 25 days"

**Prevention:**
Should use rates (1/10 + 1/15), not add days directly!

---

### Mistake 2: Forgetting to Use LCM

**Error:**
"1/6 + 1/8 = 2/14 = 1/7... no wait"

**Prevention:**
Always find LCM first for clean fractions

---

## PART 6: INTERVIEW TIPS (DAY 4)

💡 **Tip 1: Always convert to "fraction of job per day"**
"A's rate is 1/12 per day"
Makes calculation uniform

💡 **Tip 2: Use LCM for adding rates**
"LCM of 6 and 8 is 24, so..."
Avoids decimal mess

💡 **Tip 3: Verify by checking total work**
"A does 4/7, B does 3/7, total = 1 full job" ✓
Shows careful approach

---

## PART 7: PRACTICE QUESTIONS (DAY 4)

**Q4.1:** A completes in 8 days. Work in 3 days?
**Solution:** 3/8 of job

**Q4.2:** A (6d), B (12d) together?

# 📅 DAY 5 (FRIDAY): TIME/WORK – ADVANCED CONCEPTS

## 🎯 TODAY'S LEARNING OBJECTIVE

By end of today, you will:
- ✅ Solve time/work with efficiency variations
- ✅ Handle variable number of workers
- ✅ Master pipe/tap problems (inlet, outlet, drain)
- ✅ Distribute wages based on work done
- ✅ Solve complex real-world scenarios

---

## PART 1: WORK WITH EFFICIENCY VARIATIONS (ADVANCED)

### When Workers Have Different Speeds

**Scenario:**
Some workers are more efficient (work faster) than others

### Example 5.1: Efficiency Comparison

```
Q: A is 3 times as fast as B
   Together they complete in 18 hours
   A alone takes how many hours?

Solution:
Let B's rate = r
A's rate = 3r (three times faster)

Combined = 3r + r = 4r = 1/18

r = 1/72

A's rate = 3/72 = 1/24
B's rate = 1/72

A alone = 24 hours
B alone = 72 hours

Verification:
Together: 1/24 + 1/72 = 3/72 + 1/72 = 4/72 = 1/18 ✓
```

---

## PART 2: VARIABLE NUMBER OF WORKERS

### When Workforce Changes During Project

### Example 5.2: Workers Leaving Mid-Project

```
Q: 10 workers complete job in 20 days
   After 5 days, 2 workers leave due to illness
   How many additional days needed?

Solution:
Total work = 10 workers × 20 days = 200 worker-days

In first 5 days: 10 × 5 = 50 worker-days completed
Remaining: 200 - 50 = 150 worker-days

After 2 leave: 8 workers remain
Days for remaining work = 150 / 8 = 18.75 days

Total time = 5 + 18.75 = 23.75 days (vs original 20)
Extra days = 23.75 - 20 = 3.75 days

Interpretation:
Losing workers delays project by 3.75 days
```

---

### Example 5.3: Workers Joining Mid-Project

```
Q: 12 workers at work on project
   After 8 days, 4 more workers join
   If total 30 days initially planned
   How many days will it take now?

Solution:
Method 1: Worker-days approach
Original plan: 12 × 30 = 360 worker-days

In first 8 days: 12 × 8 = 96 worker-days
Remaining: 360 - 96 = 264 worker-days

With 16 workers: 264 / 16 = 16.5 days

Total time = 8 + 16.5 = 24.5 days (vs original 30)
Time saved = 30 - 24.5 = 5.5 days
```

---

## PART 3: PIPE/TAP PROBLEMS (ADVANCED)

### Understanding Inlet, Outlet, and Drain

**Inlet Tap:** Fills the tank (positive rate)
**Outlet/Drain:** Empties the tank (negative rate)

### Example 5.4: Multiple Inlets and One Drain

```
Q: Tap A fills tank in 3 hours
   Tap B fills tank in 4 hours
   Drain C empties tank in 6 hours
   
   All three open together. When full?

Solution:
A's rate = 1/3 per hour (fills)
B's rate = 1/4 per hour (fills)
C's rate = -1/6 per hour (empties)

Net rate = 1/3 + 1/4 - 1/6

LCM(3, 4, 6) = 12
= 4/12 + 3/12 - 2/12 = 5/12 per hour

Time to fill = 1 / (5/12) = 12/5 = 2.4 hours = 2 hours 24 minutes

Verification:
In 2.4 hours:
A fills: 2.4 × (1/3) = 0.8 tanks
B fills: 2.4 × (1/4) = 0.6 tanks
C empties: 2.4 × (1/6) = 0.4 tanks
Net: 0.8 + 0.6 - 0.4 = 1 tank ✓
```

---

### Example 5.5: Tap Problem with Timing

```
Q: Tap A fills in 4 hours
   Tap B fills in 5 hours
   Drain opens at full tank level
   
   If A and B open for 2 hours, then drain opens at full level
   Tank empties in 6 hours when drain alone
   Total time to empty from full?

Solution:
In 2 hours with A and B:
A fills: 2 × (1/4) = 1/2
B fills: 2 × (1/5) = 2/5
Total: 1/2 + 2/5 = 5/10 + 4/10 = 9/10 of tank

Remaining to fill: 1 - 9/10 = 1/10

A + B continue:
Combined rate = 1/4 + 1/5 = 9/20 per hour
Time to reach full from 9/10: (1/10) / (9/20) = (1/10) × (20/9) = 2/9 hour

Total to reach full: 2 + 2/9 = 20/9 hours

Then drain opens:
Drain rate = 1/6 per hour
Time to empty = 1 / (1/6) = 6 hours

Total time from start = 20/9 + 6 = 20/9 + 54/9 = 74/9 ≈ 8.22 hours
```

---

## PART 4: WORK WITH VARYING EFFICIENCY

### When Workers Speed Up or Slow Down

### Example 5.6: Efficiency Change During Project

```
Q: A and B together complete job in 12 days
   A works at rate 1/15 per day
   
   After 4 days, A increases speed by 50%
   How long for B to finish remaining work?

Solution:
B's rate = 1/12 - 1/15 = 5/60 - 4/60 = 1/60 per day

Phase 1: First 4 days at original rate
A's work: 4 × (1/15) = 4/15
B's work: 4 × (1/60) = 4/60 = 1/15
Total: 4/15 + 1/15 = 5/15 = 1/3

Remaining: 1 - 1/3 = 2/3

Phase 2: A speeds up by 50%
A's new rate = 1.5 × (1/15) = 1.5/15 = 1/10 per day

Both continue:
Combined = 1/10 + 1/60 = 6/60 + 1/60 = 7/60 per day

Time for remaining 2/3:
(2/3) / (7/60) = (2/3) × (60/7) = 120/21 = 40/7 ≈ 5.71 days

Total: 4 + 40/7 = 28/7 + 40/7 = 68/7 ≈ 9.71 days
```

---

## PART 5: COMBINED WORK & WAGE DISTRIBUTION

### Wages Based on Work Done

### Example 5.7: Work Distribution with Wages

```
Q: Two workers A and B
   A alone completes in 10 days (rate 1/10)
   B alone completes in 15 days (rate 1/15)
   
   A works 6 days, B works 6 days (concurrent)
   Total wage = ₹2,400
   Split based on work done

Solution:
Work done in 6 days each:
A: 6 × (1/10) = 6/10 = 3/5
B: 6 × (1/15) = 6/15 = 2/5
Total: 3/5 + 2/5 = 1 ✓ (complete job)

Wage split (proportional to work):
A's share: (3/5) × 2,400 = ₹1,440
B's share: (2/5) × 2,400 = ₹960

Verification:
1,440 + 960 = 2,400 ✓
Ratio: 1,440:960 = 3:2 = 3/5:2/5 ✓
```

---

### Example 5.8: Three-Person Wage Distribution

```
Q: Three partners invest (Capital × Time):
A: ₹100,000 for 12 months (whole year)
B: ₹75,000 for 12 months
C: ₹50,000 for 8 months (left early)

Profit = ₹60,000

Find each person's profit share

Solution:
Capital × Time ratio:
A: 100,000 × 12 = 12,00,000
B: 75,000 × 12 = 9,00,000
C: 50,000 × 8 = 4,00,000

Simplify by dividing by 100,000:
A: 12, B: 9, C: 4
Ratio: 12:9:4

Total parts = 12 + 9 + 4 = 25

A's share: (12/25) × 60,000 = ₹28,800
B's share: (9/25) × 60,000 = ₹21,600
C's share: (4/25) × 60,000 = ₹9,600

Verification:
28,800 + 21,600 + 9,600 = 60,000 ✓
Ratio: 28,800:21,600:9,600 = 12:9:4 ✓

Business insight:
C left early, so gets less despite same capital rate
Capital × Time model is fair
```

---

## PART 6: COMPLEX REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS

### Example 5.9: Multi-Phase Project

```
Q: Project has 3 phases:
Phase 1: 12 workers for 5 days (foundation)
Phase 2: 15 workers for 8 days (structure)
Phase 3: 8 workers for 4 days (finishing)

Total wage budget: ₹96,000

Each day's work = 1 unit
Calculate total work done and wage per unit

Solution:
Phase 1: 12 × 5 = 60 worker-days = 60 units
Phase 2: 15 × 8 = 120 worker-days = 120 units
Phase 3: 8 × 4 = 32 worker-days = 32 units

Total: 60 + 120 + 32 = 212 worker-days

Wage per worker-day = 96,000 / 212 = ₹452.83 per day

Phase distributions:
Phase 1: 60 × 452.83 = ₹27,170
Phase 2: 120 × 452.83 = ₹54,340
Phase 3: 32 × 452.83 = ₹14,490

Verification: 27,170 + 54,340 + 14,490 = 96,000 ✓
```

---

### Example 5.10: Job with Multiple Rates

```
Q: Junior worker rate: 1/20 per day
   Senior worker rate: 1/10 per day
   
   2 junior + 1 senior work for 5 days
   Then 1 junior + 2 senior work for 3 days
   
   Total work completed?

Solution:
Phase 1 (5 days): 2 junior + 1 senior
Work = 5 × (2 × 1/20 + 1 × 1/10)
     = 5 × (2/20 + 1/10)
     = 5 × (1/10 + 1/10)
     = 5 × (2/10)
     = 5 × (1/5)
     = 1 (complete one job)

Phase 2 (3 days): 1 junior + 2 senior
Work = 3 × (1/20 + 2/10)
     = 3 × (1/20 + 4/20)
     = 3 × (5/20)
     = 3 × (1/4)
     = 3/4 (0.75 of a job)

Total work: 1 + 3/4 = 1.75 jobs

## PART 7: COMMON MISTAKES (DAY 5)

### Mistake 1: Not Handling Negative Rates for Drains

**Error:**
Adding drain rate instead of subtracting

**Prevention:**
Drain/outlet = NEGATIVE rate
Net = Inlet - Outlet

---

### Mistake 2: Confusing Worker-Days

**Error:**
"10 workers × 20 days = 200 days work"

**Prevention:**
10 workers × 20 days = 200 WORKER-DAYS
(measure of total effort)

---

### Mistake 3: Wrong Wage Distribution

**Error:**
Splitting equally when work is unequal

**Prevention:**
Wages proportional to WORK DONE, not days worked

---

## PART 8: INTERVIEW TIPS (DAY 5)

💡 **Tip 1: Use worker-days for variable workforce**
"Total = 10 × 20 = 200 worker-days"
Shows systematic thinking

💡 **Tip 2: Use negative rates for drains**
"Net rate = 1/3 - 1/6" (shows mathematical sophistication)

💡 **Tip 3: Always verify wage calculations**
"A:B = 3:5, so 3/(3+5) × total"
Shows proportional thinking

💡 **Tip 4: Draw timeline for complex problems**
Helps visualize when workers start/stop
Shows clarity of thinking

💡 **Tip 5: Connect to real business problems**
"This is how projects schedule workers"
Shows practical understanding
