# 📅 DAY 1: PERCENTAGES – FOUNDATION & CHANGE

## Part 1.1: Why Percentages Were Invented 

### The Problem Before Percentages

**Ancient Trade Scenario (1000 CE):**
```
Merchant A sells cloth: 15 out of 30 pieces sold
Merchant B sells silk: 25 out of 50 pieces sold
Who is better at selling?

Without percentages: 
- A sold 15 pieces (smaller number)
- B sold 25 pieces (larger number)
- Conclusion: B is better? (25 > 15)

With percentages:
- A: (15/30) × 100 = 50% sold
- B: (25/50) × 100 = 50% sold
- Conclusion: Both equally good!

Percentages allow fair comparison across different-sized groups.
```

**Why it matters today:**
- Compare companies of different sizes
- Understand growth rates fairly
- Make informed decisions
- Avoid being misled by raw numbers

---

## Part 1.2: What is a Percentage? 

### Formal Mathematical Definition

**Definition 1 (Standard):**
A percentage is a number expressed as a fraction of 100. It represents a ratio comparing a part to a whole on a standardized scale of 100.

**Notation:**
```
Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100
Symbol: %
```

**Definition 2 (Conceptual):**
Percentage is a PROPORTIONAL COMPARISON - it shows what amount you'd have if the total were exactly 100.

**Definition 3 (Practical):**
Percentage tells you "for every 100 units of reference, how many units of measurement?"

### Why BASE (Whole) is CRITICAL

**Key Insight:** The "whole" (base) is YOUR REFERENCE POINT. It's the thing everything else is compared to.

**Deep Concept Example 1A: Pass Rates**

School A: 15 students passed, 30 total students
School B: 20 students passed, 50 total students

**WITHOUT understanding base:**
- School B had more passes (20 > 15) → Seems better
- But this is MEANINGLESS comparison (different group sizes!)

**WITH understanding base:**
- School A: 15/30 = 50% pass rate (BASE = 30 total)
- School B: 20/50 = 40% pass rate (BASE = 50 total)
- Conclusion: School A is BETTER despite fewer actual passes!

**The insight:** Same absolute number (passes) but DIFFERENT relative importance because different bases.

This is why percentage is so powerful - it removes base distortion.

---

### Visual Representation: Why Base Matters

```
School A:        School B:
Passed (15)      Passed (20)
███████████      ████████████████████
███████████      ████████████████████
Failed (15)      Failed (30)
███████████      ██████████████████████████████
███████████      ██████████████████████████████

Raw comparison: B looks better (more passes)
Percentage view: 
  A: ███████████████████ 50%
  B: ████████████████ 40%
A is actually better!
```

---

## Part 1.3: The Percentage Formula 

### Basic Formula Explained

```
Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100
```

**Each component:**
- **Part:** What we're measuring / What we're interested in
- **Whole:** Total amount / Reference point / Base
- **× 100:** Scale to 100 (standardization)

### Why Multiply by 100?

**Without ×100:**
```
15/30 = 0.5 (this is hard to compare)
```

**With ×100:**
```
15/30 × 100 = 50 (much easier - out of 100 standard)
```

Multiplying by 100 converts to standard scale where comparison is intuitive.

---

## Part 1.4: Understanding Percentage Change 

### What "Change" Really Means

**Common mistake:**
"Value changed from 20 to 25" 
Student thinks: "5 out of 25 = 20%"

**Reality:**
"Value changed from 20 to 25"
Correct: "5 out of 20 (original) = 25%"

**WHY?** Change is always calculated from the ORIGINAL value, never the new value.

### The Full Percentage Change Formula

```
Percentage Change = (Change / Original) × 100

Where:
Change = New Value - Original Value
Original = Starting Point (this is the BASE)
```

### Deep Example 1A: Salary Increase 

**Scenario:**
Employee A: Salary ₹20,000 → ₹24,000
Employee B: Salary ₹1,00,000 → ₹1,02,000

**Which employee got a better raise?**

**Calculation for A:**
```
Change = 24,000 - 20,000 = ₹4,000
Original = ₹20,000
% Change = (4,000 / 20,000) × 100 = 20%
```

**Calculation for B:**
```
Change = 1,02,000 - 1,00,000 = ₹2,000
Original = ₹1,00,000  
% Change = (2,000 / 1,00,000) × 100 = 2%
```

**The Insight:**
- A got 20% raise (better!)
- B got 2% raise
- Even though B got more absolute money (₹2,000 vs ₹4,000), A's percentage is higher

**Why?** A's base (₹20K) is smaller, so the same ₹4K is a bigger proportion of it.

**Life Application:**
If you earn ₹20K and get ₹4K raise, that's significant (20%).
If you earn ₹100K and get ₹4K raise, that's negligible (4%).

---

### Deep Example 1B: Investment Returns

**Scenario:**
Investor X: Invested ₹100, earned ₹50 (50% return)
Investor Y: Invested ₹1,000, earned ₹500 (50% return)

**Question:** Who made more money?

**Answer:** Both earned 50% but...
- X has ₹150 total (doubled + extra)
- Y has ₹1,500 total (doubled + extra)

Y is much richer even though both got 50% return!

**Lesson:** Percentage and absolute amount are both important. Same percentage with different bases = different outcomes.

---

### The Multiplier Method (Alternative Representation)

**Instead of thinking about formulas, think about multipliers.**

**If something increases by x%:**
```
New Value = Original × (1 + x/100)
Multiplier = 1 + x/100
```

**If something decreases by x%:**
```
New Value = Original × (1 - x/100)
Multiplier = 1 - x/100
```

**Examples:**

Increase by 20%:
```
Multiplier = 1 + 0.20 = 1.20
If original = 100:
New = 100 × 1.20 = 120 ✓
```

Decrease by 30%:
```
Multiplier = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70
If original = 100:
New = 100 × 0.70 = 70 ✓
```

**Why multipliers matter:** Makes successive changes MUCH easier.

---

## Part 1.5: Increase vs Decrease (Asymmetry Discovery)

### Increasing Percentage

**Formula:**
```
New = Original × (1 + rate/100)
Increase% = (New - Original) / Original × 100
```

**Deep Example 2A: Store Inflation**

```
Original price: ₹500 (for a product)
Inflation rate: 12% increase
Calculation:
New price = 500 × (1 + 12/100) = 500 × 1.12 = ₹560

Verification:
Increase = 560 - 500 = ₹60
Rate = (60/500) × 100 = 12% ✓

Meaning: For every ₹100 of original price, you now pay ₹112
Or: For every ₹100, you pay ₹12 extra
```

---

### Decreasing Percentage

**Formula:**
```
New = Original × (1 - rate/100)
Decrease% = (Original - New) / Original × 100
```

**Deep Example 2B: Store Discount**

```
Marked price: ₹1,000
Discount: 25%
Calculation:
Sale price = 1,000 × (1 - 25/100) = 1,000 × 0.75 = ₹750

Verification:
Decrease = 1,000 - 750 = ₹250
Rate = (250/1,000) × 100 = 25% ✓

Meaning: For every ₹100 of marked price, you pay ₹75
Or: You save ₹25 on every ₹100
```

---

### CRITICAL INSIGHT: +x% Then -x% ≠ Back to Original

**This is the most important discovery of Day 1.**

**The Question:**
If a price increases by 20% then decreases by 20%, do you end up where you started?

**Intuitive answer:** Yes (symmetric changes)

**Actual answer:** NO - you end up LOWER!

**Proof:**

```
Start: ₹100

Step 1: Increase by 20%
Multiplier = 1.20
New = 100 × 1.20 = ₹120

Step 2: Decrease by 20% (from ₹120, not ₹100!)
Multiplier = 0.80
Final = 120 × 0.80 = ₹96

Result: ₹96 ≠ ₹100 (We're DOWN ₹4!)
```

**Why This Happens:**

- +20% adds: 100 × 0.20 = ₹20 (20% of ₹100)
- -20% subtracts: 120 × 0.20 = ₹24 (20% of ₹120, which is larger!)

₹24 > ₹20, so net loss!

**General Formula (CRITICAL FOR INTERVIEWS):**

```
If you do +x% then -x%:

Net multiplier = (1 + x/100) × (1 - x/100)
                = 1 - (x²/10000)
                = 1 - x²/100 % loss

NET LOSS = (x²/100) %
```

**Examples:**

+10% then -10%:
```
Loss = (10²/100) = 100/100 = 1% loss
Final = 99% of original
```

+20% then -20%:
```
Loss = (20²/100) = 400/100 = 4% loss
Final = 96% of original
```

+50% then -50%:
```
Loss = (50²/100) = 2500/100 = 25% loss
Final = 75% of original
```

**Key Learning:** Increases and decreases are NOT symmetric! Decreases hurt more.

## Part 1.6: Worked Examples (10+ Examples)

### Example 1.1: Simple Percentage Calculation

```
Q: 25 students passed out of 80. What percentage passed?

Solution:
Part = 25 (students who passed)
Whole = 80 (total students)
Percentage = (25/80) × 100 = 31.25%

Meaning: Out of 100 students (scaled), 31.25 passed
Or: For every 100 students, roughly 31 pass
```

---

### Example 1.2: Finding Part from Percentage

```
Q: 30% of 150 students are science majors. How many?

Solution:
Percentage = 30%
Whole = 150
Part = ?

Part = (30/100) × 150 = 45 students
```

---

### Example 1.3: Finding Whole from Part & Percentage

```
Q: 45 students are 30% of the total. What's the total?

Solution:
Part = 45
Percentage = 30%
Whole = ?

45 = (30/100) × Whole
Whole = 45 × (100/30) = 150 students
```

---

### Example 1.4: Percentage Increase

```
Q: Stock price was ₹200. Now it's ₹250. What's the % increase?

Solution:
Original = ₹200
New = ₹250
Change = 250 - 200 = ₹50

% Change = (50/200) × 100 = 25%

Meaning: Stock increased by 25% from original price
```

---

### Example 1.5: Percentage Decrease

```
Q: Product was ₹500. Discounted to ₹375. What's the % decrease?

Solution:
Original = ₹500
New = ₹375
Change = 500 - 375 = ₹125

% Decrease = (125/500) × 100 = 25%

Meaning: Product decreased by 25% from original price
```

---

### Example 1.6: The Asymmetry Trap

```
Q: Stock was ₹100. It increased by 50% to ₹150.
   Then decreased by 50% to ₹?

Solution:
After increase: 100 × 1.50 = ₹150
After decrease: 150 × 0.50 = ₹75

Final = ₹75 (NOT ₹100!)
Loss = (75 - 100)/100 × 100 = 25% loss

Using formula: Loss = (50²/100) = 25% ✓
```

---

### Example 1.7: Real-World Salary

```
Q: Employee earned ₹30,000. Got 15% raise to ₹?
   Then 15% tax applied. Final salary = ?

Solution:
Step 1: Increase by 15%
After raise = 30,000 × 1.15 = ₹34,500

Step 2: Tax 15% on new salary
Tax amount = 34,500 × 0.15 = ₹5,175
Final salary = 34,500 - 5,175 = ₹29,325

Net change from original:
(29,325 - 30,000) / 30,000 × 100 = -2.25%

Surprise: Despite 15% raise, salary decreased by 2.25%!
Why? Tax is 15% of larger amount (₹34,500) vs raise is only 15% of smaller (₹30,000)
```

---

### Example 1.8: Multiple Comparisons

```
Q: Compare marks:
   Student A: 72 out of 90 marks
   Student B: 60 out of 75 marks

Who scored better percentage-wise?

Solution A:
(72/90) × 100 = 80%

Solution B:
(60/75) × 100 = 80%

Answer: Same percentage! (80% each)
But different absolute marks (72 vs 60) and different bases (90 vs 75).
Percentage shows they performed equally well.
```

---

### Example 1.9: Understanding Base Bias

```
Q: Sales in 2 cities:
   City A: 80 items sold out of 100 items = 80%
   City B: 8 items sold out of 10 items = 80%

Sales manager says "Both cities have same performance!"
Is this true?

Solution:
Percentages: Both 80% ✓
But absolutely:
- City A sold 80 items
- City B sold 8 items

Conclusion: While percentages are same, City A is vastly more important (10x more items)!

Lesson: Always consider both percentage AND absolute numbers.
```

---

### Example 1.10: Compound Changes

```
Q: Price increases by 10%, then by 20%.
   Total increase = ?

Wrong answer: 10% + 20% = 30%

Correct answer:
After 10%: Original × 1.10
After 20%: (Original × 1.10) × 1.20 = Original × 1.32
Total: 32% increase (not 30%!)

Why? Second 20% is on the already-increased amount.
```

---

## Part 1.7: Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Using New Value as Base

**Student Error:**
```
"Salary increased from ₹20,000 to ₹24,000"
Student calculates: 4,000 / 24,000 × 100 = 16.67%
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
Percentage change ALWAYS uses ORIGINAL as base, never final value!

**Correct:**
```
4,000 / 20,000 × 100 = 20%
```

**Cognitive Reason:**
Students focus on the latest/most visible number. This is called "recency bias" - brain defaults to most recent information.

**Prevention:**
Always ask: "Compared to what?"
If problem says "increase," it's compared to ORIGINAL.

---

### Mistake 2: Assuming Percentage is Always Out of 100

**Student Error:**
```
"75% of 200 is 75"
Student thinks: Percentage = actual part
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
Percentage is a RATIO, not an absolute amount.

**Correct:**
```
75% of 200 = (75/100) × 200 = 150
```

**Prevention:**
Remember: % shows RELATIONSHIP, not absolute value.
200 might be 100%, 75 might be 75%.

---

### Mistake 3: Thinking +10% then -10% = 0%

**Student Error:**
```
"Stock up 10%, then down 10%. Back to original!"
```

**Why It's Wrong:**
Decreases are on larger base, so subtract more.

**Correct:**
```
+10%: Multiply by 1.10
-10%: Multiply by 0.90 (on the new amount)
Result: 1.10 × 0.90 = 0.99 = 99% (1% loss!)
```

**Cognitive Reason:**
Symmetry bias - students expect symmetric operations to cancel out. They don't in percentages!

---

## Part 1.8: Interview Tips

💡 **Tip 1: Always show the base**
"I'm calculating change from ₹20,000 (original), not ₹24,000 (new)"
Shows deep understanding.

💡 **Tip 2: Explain WHY increases and decreases aren't symmetric**
"When we increase by x%, we multiply by (1+x/100).
When we decrease by x%, we multiply by (1-x/100).
These multipliers aren't inverses, so +x% then -x% ≠ 0%"
Impresses with mathematical insight.

💡 **Tip 3: Use multiplier method for complex problems**
Instead of calculating change each time, chain multipliers.
Shows efficiency.

💡 **Tip 4: Always verify with small numbers**
"Let me check with ₹100 to make sure my logic is right"
Shows careful thinking.

# 📅 DAY 2: SUCCESSIVE PERCENTAGES & APPLICATIONS

## Part 2.1: Why Successive Percentages Are Different

### The Core Problem: Compounding

**Real-Life Scenario:**
```
Company growth over 2 years:
Year 1: 30% growth
Year 2: 20% growth

CEO thinks: Total growth = 30% + 20% = 50%

But is this correct?
```

**Analysis:**

```
Start: ₹100 (company value)
After Year 1 (30% growth): ₹100 × 1.30 = ₹130
After Year 2 (20% growth): ₹130 × 1.20 = ₹156

Total growth: (156 - 100) / 100 × 100 = 56%

NOT 50%!
```

**Why:** Year 2's 20% is calculated on ₹130 (larger base), not original ₹100.

---

## Part 2.2: The Successive Percentage Formula 

### Formula:

```
Net% = a + b + (a × b / 100)

Where:
a = first percentage (+ for increase, - for decrease)
b = second percentage (+ for increase, - for decrease)
```

### Mathematical Proof:

```
Let Original = P

After first change: P × (1 + a/100)
After second change: P × (1 + a/100) × (1 + b/100)

Expand the product:
= P × [1 + a/100 + b/100 + (a×b)/10000]
= P × [1 + (a + b + ab/100)/100]

So the net percentage = a + b + (ab/100)
```

### Visual Understanding:

```
Change 1: a% of P = (a/100) × P
Change 2: b% of (P + Change 1) = (b/100) × (P + Change 1)
          = (b/100) × P + (b/100) × (a/100) × P
          = (b/100) × P + (ab/10000) × P

Total change = (a/100) × P + (b/100) × P + (ab/10000) × P
             = [(a + b + ab/100)/100] × P
             = a + b + (ab/100) as percentage

The (ab/100) term is the "interaction" - it's how much the second change affects the extra created by first change.
```

---

## Part 2.3: Deep Example – Company Growth (3 Years)

### Scenario:

```
Company value: ₹1,00,000 (initial)
Year 1: 15% growth
Year 2: 10% growth  
Year 3: -5% (recession loss)

Find: Final value and net percentage change
```

### Solution Method 1: Step-by-Step with Multipliers

```
Initial: ₹1,00,000

After Year 1: 100,000 × 1.15 = ₹1,15,000
After Year 2: 115,000 × 1.10 = ₹1,26,500
After Year 3: 126,500 × 0.95 = ₹1,20,175

Net change: (120,175 - 100,000) / 100,000 × 100 = 20.175%
```

### Solution Method 2: Multiplier Chain

```
Total multiplier = 1.15 × 1.10 × 0.95 = 1.20175
Net% = (1.20175 - 1) × 100 = 20.175% ✓
```

### Solution Method 3: Using Formula (Two at a Time)

```
Step 1: Combine Year 1 and 2
Net% = 15 + 10 + (15 × 10 / 100)
     = 25 + 1.5
     = 26.5%

So after 2 years: Value = 100,000 × 1.265 = ₹1,26,500 ✓

Step 2: Apply Year 3
Initial for Year 3: 26.5%
Change in Year 3: -5%
Net% = 26.5 + (-5) + (26.5 × (-5) / 100)
     = 26.5 - 5 - 1.325
     = 20.175% ✓
```

## Part 2.4: Profit, Loss & Discount Applications

### Part 2.4A: Profit and Loss 

**Definitions:**

```
Cost Price (CP) = What we paid to acquire
Selling Price (SP) = What we sold it for
Profit = SP - CP (if positive)
Loss = CP - SP (if positive)

Profit% = (Profit / CP) × 100
Loss% = (Loss / CP) × 100

KEY: Base is ALWAYS CP, because profit is on your investment!
```

**Why CP is Base:**

```
If you invested ₹400 and sold for ₹520:
Profit = ₹120
Profit% = (120/400) × 100 = 30%

This means: "For every ₹100 you invest, you earn ₹30 profit"

If we used SP as base: (120/520) × 100 = 23% - WRONG, doesn't show return on investment
```

---

### Deep Example 2A: Shopkeeper Profit

```
Q: A shopkeeper buys a product for ₹400 and sells for ₹520.
   Find profit and profit percentage.

Solution:
CP = ₹400
SP = ₹520
Profit = 520 - 400 = ₹120

Profit% = (120/400) × 100 = 30%

Interpretation:
- For every ₹100 of cost price, profit is ₹30
- For every ₹100, selling price is ₹130

If buying goods worth ₹10,000:
Expected profit = 30% of 10,000 = ₹3,000
Selling price should be = ₹13,000
```

---

### Part 2.4B: Discount 

**Definitions:**

```
Marked Price (MP) = Price tag shown
Discount = Reduction in price
Selling Price (SP) = What customer actually pays

Discount% = (Discount / MP) × 100

KEY: Base is ALWAYS MP, because discount is reduction from marked price!
```

---

### Deep Example 2B: Store Discount

```
Q: A shop marks a product at ₹1,000 and gives 25% discount.
   What does customer pay?

Solution:
MP = ₹1,000
Discount% = 25%
Discount amount = (25/100) × 1,000 = ₹250
SP = 1,000 - 250 = ₹750

Or directly: SP = MP × (1 - discount%) = 1,000 × 0.75 = ₹750

Interpretation:
- Customer saves ₹25 on every ₹100 of marked price
- Customer pays ₹75 on every ₹100 of marked price
```

---

### Part 2.4C: Multiple Discounts

**The Mistake:** Adding discounts

```
Wrong: 20% + 10% = 30% total discount
Correct: 20% then 10% is NOT 30%!
```

**Why:**

```
Original MP: ₹1,000

First discount 20%:
Amount reduced = 1,000 × 0.20 = ₹200
Price becomes = 1,000 - 200 = ₹800

Second discount 10% (on ₹800, NOT original ₹1,000):
Amount reduced = 800 × 0.10 = ₹80
Price becomes = 800 - 80 = ₹720

Total reduction: (1,000 - 720) / 1,000 × 100 = 28%

NOT 30%!
```

**Using Formula:**

For successive discounts, use:
```
Net discount% = a + b - (a × b / 100)

NOTE: SUBTRACT the product, not add (opposite of growth)
```

```
= 20 + 10 - (20 × 10 / 100)
= 30 - 2
= 28% ✓
```

## Part 2.5: Integration Example – Salary with Tax

### Deep Example 2C: Real Salary Scenario

```
Q: Employee salary ₹40,000
   Gets 10% hike
   Pays 15% tax on new salary
   What's final take-home salary?

Solution:

Step 1: Apply hike
After hike = 40,000 × 1.10 = ₹44,000

Step 2: Calculate tax on new salary
Tax = 44,000 × 0.15 = ₹6,600
Take-home = 44,000 - 6,600 = ₹37,400

Step 3: Net change from original
(37,400 - 40,000) / 40,000 × 100 = -6.5%

SURPRISE: Despite 10% hike, employee earns LESS!

Why? Tax on new amount (₹6,600) > Hike amount (₹4,000)
The tax eats up the hike plus ₹2,600 more!

Using multipliers:
1.10 × (1 - 0.15) = 1.10 × 0.85 = 0.935
So: 40,000 × 0.935 = ₹37,400 ✓
Result: 93.5% of original = 6.5% loss
```

---

## Part 2.6: Worked Examples  (12+ Examples)

### Example 2.1: Basic Successive Percentage

```
Q: Price increases 20%, then 30%. Total increase = ?

Wrong approach: 20 + 30 = 50%
Correct approach: 
  Use formula: 20 + 30 + (20×30/100) = 50 + 6 = 56%
Or: 100 × 1.20 × 1.30 = 156 = 56% increase
```

---

### Example 2.2: Increase Then Decrease

```
Q: Price increases 25%, then decreases 20%. Final change = ?

Using formula: 25 + (-20) + (25×(-20)/100)
             = 25 - 20 - 5
             = 0%

Wait, that's interesting! Sometimes they can cancel!

Using multipliers: 1.25 × 0.80 = 1.00 exactly
Confirmation: 0% change (back to original!)
```

---

### Example 2.3: Three Changes

```
Q: Value changes: +10%, +15%, -5%. Total change = ?

Solution:
Use multiplier chain: 1.10 × 1.15 × 0.95 = 1.20575
Net change = 20.575%

Or step-by-step:
First two: 10 + 15 + 1.5 = 26.5%
Then third: 26.5 + (-5) + (26.5 × (-5) / 100)
          = 26.5 - 5 - 1.325
          = 20.175%

(Slight difference due to rounding)
```

---

### Example 2.4: Profit Calculation

```
Q: CP = ₹300, SP = ₹450. Find profit and profit%

Solution:
Profit = 450 - 300 = ₹150
Profit% = (150 / 300) × 100 = 50%

Meaning: 50% return on investment
For every ₹100 cost, earn ₹50 profit
```

---

### Example 2.5: Loss Calculation

```
Q: CP = ₹800, SP = ₹680. Find loss and loss%

Solution:
Loss = 800 - 680 = ₹120
Loss% = (120 / 800) × 100 = 15%

Meaning: 15% loss on investment
For every ₹100 cost, lose ₹15
```

---

### Example 2.6: Single Discount

```
Q: MP = ₹2,000, Discount 15%. Find SP

Solution:
Discount amount = (15/100) × 2,000 = ₹300
SP = 2,000 - 300 = ₹1,700

Or: SP = 2,000 × (1 - 0.15) = ₹1,700
```

---

### Example 2.7: Multiple Discounts (Wrong vs Right)

```
Q: Discounts of 20% and 15%. Which is correct total?

Wrong: 20 + 15 = 35%
Right: 20 + 15 - (20 × 15 / 100) = 35 - 3 = 32%

Example: MP = ₹1,000
Using wrong formula: 1,000 × 0.65 = ₹650 ✓ Looks right
Using multipliers: 1,000 × 0.80 × 0.85 = ₹680
Actually correct: ₹680, not ₹650!

Difference: ₹30 (2% error)
```

---

### Example 2.8: Marked Price, Cost, Selling

```
Q: CP = ₹500, marked 50% above CP, discount 20%
   Find: SP, Profit, Profit%

Solution:
MP = 500 × 1.50 = ₹750
SP = 750 × (1 - 0.20) = 750 × 0.80 = ₹600

Profit = 600 - 500 = ₹100
Profit% = (100/500) × 100 = 20%
```

---

### Example 2.9: Real-World Salary (Complex)

```
Q: Salary ₹50,000
   Hike: +12%
   Tax: 18% on new salary
   Insurance deduction: 2% of new salary
   Find final take-home

Solution:
After hike: 50,000 × 1.12 = ₹56,000
Tax: 56,000 × 0.18 = ₹10,080
Insurance: 56,000 × 0.02 = ₹1,120
Take-home: 56,000 - 10,080 - 1,120 = ₹44,800

Net change: (44,800 - 50,000) / 50,000 × 100 = -10.4%

Despite 12% hike, employee earns 10.4% less!
Tax + insurance = 20% combined deduction > 12% hike
```

---

### Example 2.10: Price Variation Story

```
Q: Item price ₹1,000
   Month 1: Increases by 10% due to demand
   Month 2: Decreases by 10% due to over-supply
   Month 3: Increases by 5% due to shortage
   Find: Final price and net change

Solution using multipliers:
Final = 1,000 × 1.10 × 0.90 × 1.05
      = 1,000 × 1.0395
      = ₹1,039.50

Net change = (1,039.50 - 1,000) / 1,000 × 100 = 3.95%

Despite having +10%, -10% (which cancels), the final +5% makes it net positive!
```

---

### Example 2.11: Profit Margin with Discount

```
Q: Cost ₹400, Mark ₹600, Discount 10%
   Find: SP, Profit, Profit%, Profit margin on SP

Solution:
SP = 600 × 0.90 = ₹540
Profit = 540 - 400 = ₹140

Profit% (on CP) = (140/400) × 100 = 35%
Profit margin (on SP) = (140/540) × 100 = 25.9%

Note: Profit% and profit margin are different!
- Profit% uses CP as base (shows return on investment)
- Margin uses SP as base (shows efficiency of sales)
```

---

## Part 2.7: Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Adding Successive Percentages

**Student Error:**
"20% increase then 30% increase = 50% total"

**Why Wrong:**
Second 30% is on the new amount (1.20 × original), not original.

**Correct:**
20 + 30 + (20 × 30 / 100) = 50 + 6 = 56%

---

### Mistake 2: Confusing Profit% and Margin%

**Student Error:**
"Profit ₹100, SP ₹500, so profit% = 20%"

**Wrong:**
(100/500) × 100 = 20% (this is margin)

**Correct:**
Need CP to calculate profit%.
If CP = ₹400: (100/400) × 100 = 25%

---

### Mistake 3: Using Wrong Base for Discount

**Student Error:**
"SP = ₹750, but I don't know if discount is 20% or 25%"

**Why It's Wrong:**
Discount% is ALWAYS based on MP, not SP.

**Correct:**
If MP = ₹1,000, 25% discount → SP = ₹750 ✓

---

## Part 2.8: Interview Tips 

💡 **Tip 1: Use multiplier method for successive changes**
More efficient than formula, less error-prone.

💡 **Tip 2: Always identify the BASE in profit/discount problems**
"I'm using CP (₹400) as base for profit%"
Shows clarity.

💡 **Tip 3: Explain the logic behind successive percentage formula**
"The ab/100 term represents the interaction effect"
Shows deep understanding.

💡 **Tip 4: Sanity check with extremes**
"If discount is 100%, price becomes 0, which makes sense"
Shows thinking skills.

# 📅 DAY 3: RATIO & PROPORTION 

## Part 3.1: What is a Ratio? 

### Misconception to Eliminate First

**Wrong idea:** "Ratio 3:5 means the value is 3 or 5 or 3/5"

**Correct idea:** "Ratio 3:5 is a RELATIONSHIP describing how two quantities compare"

---

### Formal Definition

**Definition 1 (Mathematical):**
Ratio is a comparison of two quantities using division, expressed in the form a:b, where a and b are numbers.

**Definition 2 (Conceptual):**
Ratio tells us "for every a units of one thing, there are b units of another thing."

**Definition 3 (Proportional):**
Ratio is a fixed relationship that remains the same when both quantities are scaled by the same factor.

---

### Deep Example 3A: School Class

```
Teachers : Classrooms = 2 : 3

Interpretation:
"For every 2 teachers, there are 3 classrooms"

This could mean:
- 2 teachers, 3 classrooms (actual size)
- 4 teachers, 6 classrooms (doubled)
- 20 teachers, 30 classrooms (multiplied by 10)
- 1.5 teachers, 2.25 classrooms (fractional scaling)

All have same ratio 2:3!
```

---

### Why Ratio Matters: The Scaling Power

```
School A: 2 teachers, 3 classrooms (ratio 2:3)
School B: 20 teachers, 30 classrooms (ratio 2:3)
School C: 10 teachers, 15 classrooms (ratio 2:3)

All have SAME ratio, but different sizes!

With ratios, we can:
1. Compare despite different sizes
2. Scale up or down
3. Predict proportions
```

---

## Part 3.2: Equivalent Ratios (Scaling Rules)

### Core Principle

**If you multiply (or divide) BOTH parts of a ratio by the same number, the ratio stays the same.**

```
2:3 = 4:6 = 6:9 = 10:15 = 100:150

All are equivalent ratios
```

### Simplification (Reducing to Simplest Form)

```
100:150
Divide both by 10: 10:15
Divide both by 5: 2:3 (simplest form)

So 100:150 = 2:3 in simplest form
```

**Why simplify?** Makes it easier to understand.

---

### Deep Example 3B: Recipe Scaling

```
Original recipe (serves 2 people):
Flour: 200g
Sugar: 300g
Ratio flour:sugar = 200:300 = 2:3

Now scale for 10 people (5x larger):
Flour: 200 × 5 = 1,000g
Sugar: 300 × 5 = 1,500g
Ratio: 1,000:1,500 = 2:3 ✓ (still same!)

This is why recipes use ratios - they scale perfectly!
```

---

## Part 3.3: Proportion (Equal Ratios with Formula)

### Definition

**Proportion:** Statement that two ratios are equal

```
Notation: a:b :: c:d (read as "a is to b as c is to d")
Or: a/b = c/d
```

---

### The Cross Multiplication Rule

**If a:b = c:d, then a × d = b × c**

**Proof:**

```
If a/b = c/d
Multiply both sides by b × d:
(a/b) × (b × d) = (c/d) × (b × d)
a × d = b × c
```

---

### Deep Example 3C: Finding Missing Value

```
Q: If 3:4 = 12:x, find x

Solution using cross multiplication:
3 × x = 4 × 12
3x = 48
x = 16

Check: 3:4 = 0.75 and 12:16 = 0.75 ✓
```

---

### Deep Example 3D: Recipe Scaling Precision

```
Q: Recipe for 2 people needs 200g flour, 300g sugar
   How much flour and sugar for 5 people?

Solution using proportion:
People₁/Flour₁ = People₂/Flour₂
2/200 = 5/F
2F = 200 × 5
2F = 1,000
F = 500g flour

Similarly for sugar:
2/300 = 5/S
S = 750g sugar

Alternative (using ratio):
Ratio = 200:300 = 2:3
For 5 people: 2.5 × (2:3) = 5:7.5
So 5 parts flour units and 7.5 parts sugar units
If 1 unit = 100g: flour = 500g, sugar = 750g ✓
```

---

## Part 3.4: Types of Proportions

### Type 1: Direct Proportion (y increases when x increases)

**Formula:** y = kx (where k is constant)

**Real Example:**

```
Distance = Speed × Time (assuming constant speed)

If speed = 50 km/h:
- Time 1 hour → Distance 50 km
- Time 2 hours → Distance 100 km
- Time 3 hours → Distance 150 km

Distance is directly proportional to time (with k = 50)
```

---

### Type 2: Inverse Proportion (y decreases when x increases)

**Formula:** y = k/x (or xy = k)

**Real Example:**

```
Work completion: Time × Workers = Total Work

If total work = 100 worker-days:
- 1 worker: 100 days
- 2 workers: 50 days
- 5 workers: 20 days
- 10 workers: 10 days

As workers increase, days decrease proportionally
(xy = 100 stays constant)
```

---

## Part 3.5: Compound Ratios (Three or More Ratios)

### The Challenge

```
A:B = 3:4
B:C = 2:5

Find A:C = ?

Problem: B has different values (4 in first ratio, 2 in second)
Solution: Make B equal in both ratios
```

### Solution Process

```
Step 1: Find LCM of B values (4 and 2)
LCM(4, 2) = 4

Step 2: Scale first ratio so B = 4
A:B = 3:4 ✓ (already 4)

Step 3: Scale second ratio so B = 4
B:C = 2:5
Multiply both by 2: B:C = 4:10

Step 4: Combine
A:B:C = 3:4:10

Therefore A:C = 3:10
```

---

### Deep Example 3E: Supply Chain Ratios

```
Q: Supplier to Producer = 1:2
   Producer to Retailer = 3:5
   Find Supplier to Retailer

Solution:
Step 1: Identify common ratio (Producer)
Producer has value 2 in first, 3 in second
LCM(2, 3) = 6

Step 2: Scale ratios
Supplier:Producer = 1:2 → multiply by 3 → 3:6
Producer:Retailer = 3:5 → multiply by 2 → 6:10

Step 3: Combine
Supplier:Producer:Retailer = 3:6:10

Therefore Supplier:Retailer = 3:10

Interpretation: When supplier charges ₹1,
Eventually retailer charges ₹3.33
(Markup factor = 10/3 ≈ 3.33x)
```

---

## Part 3.6: Ratio & Percentage Connection

### Key Insight

**Percentage IS a ratio with standardized base 100**

```
40% = 40:100 = 2:5 (in simplest ratio form)
25% = 25:100 = 1:4
75% = 75:100 = 3:4
```

---

### Converting Ratio to Percentage

**Deep Example 3F:**

```
Boys:Girls = 3:5
Total = 3 + 5 = 8 parts

Boys percentage = (3/8) × 100 = 37.5%
Girls percentage = (5/8) × 100 = 62.5%

Check: 37.5% + 62.5% = 100% ✓

This is useful for real problems like exam results!
```

---

## Part 3.7: Common Ratio Mistakes 

### Mistake 1: Ratio as Absolute Number

**Student Error:**
"Ratio is 2:3, so the answer is 2"

**Why Wrong:**
Ratio is relationship, not quantity!

**Correct:**
2:3 could represent 2,000:3,000 or 0.2:0.3 etc.

---

### Mistake 2: Not Keeping Same Units

**Student Error:**
"Heights 150 cm and 1.5 m. Ratio = 150:1.5"

**Why Wrong:**
Must convert to same units first!

**Correct:**
150 cm : 150 cm = 1:1

---

### Mistake 3: Confusing Ratio with Percentage

**Student Error:**
"If A:B = 2:5, then A is 2% of total"

**Why Wrong:**
Total = 7, so A = (2/7) × 100 = 28.57%, not 2%!

---

## Part 3.8: Worked Examples (12+ Examples)

### Example 3.1: Simplifying Ratios

```
Q: Simplify 48:36

Solution:
Find GCD(48, 36) = 12

Yes, equivalent! ✓
```

---

### Example 3.3: Finding Part from Ratio

```
Q: A:B = 3:5, if B = 30, find A

Solution:
From ratio: A/B = 3/5
A/30 = 3/5
A = 30 × (3/5) = 18
```

---

### Example 3.4: Three Quantity Proportion

```
Q: A:B:C = 2:3:5, total = 100
   Find each part

Solution:
Total parts = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10
A = (2/10) × 100 = 20
B = (3/10) × 100 = 30
C = (5/10) × 100 = 50
Check: 20 + 30 + 50 = 100 ✓
```

---

### Example 3.5: Compound Ratio

```
Q: A:B = 2:3, B:C = 4:5
   Find A:B:C

Solution:
B values: 3 and 4
LCM = 12
A:B = 2:3 → multiply by 4 → 8:12
B:C = 4:5 → multiply by 3 → 12:15
Result: A:B:C = 8:12:15
```

---

### Example 3.6: Ratio to Percentage

```
Q: In a class, boys:girls = 4:6
   What percentage are boys?

Solution:
Total = 4 + 6 = 10
Boys% = (4/10) × 100 = 40%
Girls% = (6/10) × 100 = 60%
```

# 📅 DAY 4: PROPORTION & APPLICATIONS (INTERMEDIATE)

## Part 4.1: Direct Proportion

### Definition and Formula

**Definition:**
Two quantities are in direct proportion if one increases exactly as the other increases by same factor.

**Formula:** y = kx (where k is constant of proportionality)

**Also:** y/x = k (constant ratio)

---

### Why It Matters

```
Real Examples:
1. Total cost = Price × Quantity
2. Distance = Speed × Time
3. Salary = Daily wage × Days worked
4. Area = Length × Width

All follow y = kx pattern
```

---

### Deep Example 4A: Constant Speed Travel

```
Q: A car travels at 60 km/h. Make table for distance vs time

Solution:
Time (hours) | Distance (km)
1            | 60
2            | 120
3            | 180
4            | 240

Pattern: Distance = 60 × Time
Here k = 60 (speed)

Straight line through origin when plotted!
```

---

### Property of Direct Proportion

```
If x₁:x₂ = y₁:y₂ (ratio of x equals ratio of y)

Example:
If x doubles, y doubles
If x triples, y triples
```

---

## Part 4.2: Inverse Proportion

### Definition and Formula

**Definition:**
Two quantities are in inverse proportion if one increases as the other decreases, such that their product remains constant.

**Formula:** xy = k (or y = k/x)

**Also:** x₁y₁ = x₂y₂ (products equal)

---

### Deep Example 4B: Work Completion

```
Q: 100 worker-days of work needed.
   Make table for workers vs days

Solution:
Workers | Days | Product (Workers × Days)
1       | 100  | 100
2       | 50   | 100
4       | 25   | 100
5       | 20   | 100
10      | 10   | 100
20      | 5    | 100

Pattern: Workers × Days = 100 (constant)

Hyperbola shape when plotted!
```

---

### Property of Inverse Proportion

```
If x₁:x₂ = y₂:y₁ (ratio of x equals INVERSE ratio of y)

Example:
If workers double, days halve
If workers triple, days become 1/3
```

---

## Part 4.3: Identifying Proportion Type

### Decision Framework

```
Q: Is this direct or inverse?

Questions to ask:
1. As one increases, does other increase? → DIRECT
2. As one increases, does other decrease? → INVERSE
3. Is the ratio constant (y/x = k)? → DIRECT
4. Is the product constant (x×y = k)? → INVERSE
```

---

### Real Examples to Identify

```
1. Price per item × Number of items = Total cost
   → DIRECT (both increase together)

2. Speed × Time = Distance
   → DIRECT (as time increases, distance increases)

3. Workers × Days = Total work
   → INVERSE (more workers means fewer days)

4. Weight of object × Distance from fulcrum = Torque (moment)
   → DIRECT (both increase together)

5. Concentration × Volume = Amount of substance
   → DIRECT (both increase together)
```

---

## Part 4.4: Applications of Proportions

### Application 4A: Cost Calculation

```
Q: If 5 kg of rice costs ₹300,
   what's the cost of 12 kg?

Solution:
Cost per kg = 300/5 = ₹60 per kg (constant k)
Cost of 12 kg = 60 × 12 = ₹720

Or using proportion:
5/300 = 12/x
5x = 3,600
x = 720 ✓
```

---

### Application 4B: Time and Work

```
Q: 6 workers can complete a job in 20 days.
   How many days for 10 workers?

Solution:
This is inverse proportion: Workers × Days = constant
6 × 20 = 10 × d
120 = 10d
d = 12 days

(More workers → fewer days needed)
```

---

### Application 4C: Speed and Time

```
Q: A car takes 6 hours to travel 300 km.
   Time needed for 500 km at same speed?

Solution:
This is direct proportion: Distance ∝ Time (at constant speed)
300/6 = 500/t
300t = 3,000
t = 10 hours

(More distance → more time needed)
```

---

## Part 4.5: Worked Examples  (10+ Examples)

### Example 4.1: Direct Proportion with Constant

```
Q: y is directly proportional to x.
   When x = 4, y = 12. Find y when x = 7

Solution:
y = kx (direct proportion formula)
12 = k × 4
k = 3
So y = 3x

When x = 7:
y = 3 × 7 = 21
```

---

### Example 4.2: Inverse Proportion with Constant

```
Q: y is inversely proportional to x.
   When x = 5, y = 20. Find y when x = 8

Solution:
xy = k (inverse proportion formula)
5 × 20 = k
k = 100
So xy = 100

When x = 8:
8y = 100
y = 12.5
```

---

### Example 4.3: Money Problem (Direct)

```
Q: 10 pens cost ₹150. Cost of 25 pens?

Solution:
This is direct: Cost ∝ Quantity
Cost per pen = 150/10 = ₹15
Cost of 25 = 15 × 25 = ₹375
```

---

### Example 4.4: Worker Problem (Inverse)

```
Q: 8 workers complete job in 15 days.
   How many days for 12 workers?

Solution:
Workers × Days = constant
8 × 15 = 12 × d
120 = 12d
d = 10 days
```

---

## Part 4.6: Common Mistakes 

### Mistake 1: Confusing Direct and Inverse

**Student Error:**
"More workers means more days" (inverse)

**Correct:**
"More workers means FEWER days"

---

### Mistake 2: Using Wrong Constant Type

**Student Error:**
"Using y = kx formula for inverse proportion problem"

**Correct:**
"Use xy = k for inverse"

---

## Part 4.7: Interview Tips 

💡 **Tip 1: Identify proportion type first**
"This is inverse because more workers → fewer days"
Shows clear thinking.

💡 **Tip 2: Find the constant explicitly**
"k = 15 (cost per pen)" makes solution transparent.

💡 **Tip 3: Check reasonableness**
"If workers double, days should halve"
Shows verification habit.

---

## Part 4.8: Practice Questions (8 Questions)

**Q4.1:** y ∝ x. When x = 3, y = 9. Find y when x = 8

**Q4.2:** y ∝ 1/x. When x = 6, y = 8. Find y when x = 4

# 📅 DAY 5: INTEGRATED APTITUDE (ADVANCED APPLICATIONS)

## Part 5.1: Complex Real-World Problems

### Problem Type 1: Multi-Step Business Scenario

**Deep Example 5A: Complete Business Analysis**

```
Q: A shopkeeper buys products at ₹200 per unit.
   Marks them at 60% above cost.
   Gives two successive discounts: 15% and 10%.
   Sells 50 units.
   
   Tax: 18% on profit
   
   Find: 1) Final selling price
         2) Total profit before tax
         3) Profit percentage
         4) Net profit after tax

Solution:

Step 1: Calculate marked price
MP = 200 × (1 + 60/100) = 200 × 1.60 = ₹320

Step 2: Apply successive discounts
After 15% discount: 320 × 0.85 = ₹272
After 10% discount: 272 × 0.90 = ₹244.80
Final SP = ₹244.80

Or using formula: 
Net discount = 15 + 10 - (15×10/100) = 25 - 1.5 = 23.5%
SP = 320 × (1 - 0.235) = 320 × 0.765 = ₹244.80 ✓

Step 3: Calculate profit per unit
Profit per unit = 244.80 - 200 = ₹44.80
Profit % = (44.80/200) × 100 = 22.4%

Step 4: Calculate for 50 units
Total revenue = 244.80 × 50 = ₹12,240
Total cost = 200 × 50 = ₹10,000
Total profit before tax = ₹2,240

Step 5: Calculate tax and net profit
Tax = 2,240 × 0.18 = ₹403.20
Net profit after tax = 2,240 - 403.20 = ₹1,836.80

Analysis:
- Marked price was ₹320, sold at ₹244.80 (23.5% less than marked)
- Still made 22.4% profit on cost!
- Tax reduced profit by 18%, netting ₹1,836.80 on 50 units
- Per unit net profit = ₹1,836.80 / 50 = ₹36.74
```

### Problem Type 2: Salary and Tax Complexity

**Deep Example 5B: Complete Salary Analysis**

```
Q: Employee earning ₹50,000 monthly.
   Receives performance bonus: 25% of salary
   Then receives festival bonus: 10% of (salary + performance bonus)
   Then pays taxes: 20% on total income
   Insurance: 2% on gross (before tax)
   
   Calculate: 1) Gross income after bonuses
              2) Tax amount
              3) Net take-home
              4) Effective percentage gained/lost

Solution:

Step 1: Performance bonus
Performance bonus = 50,000 × 0.25 = ₹12,500
Running total = 50,000 + 12,500 = ₹62,500

Step 2: Festival bonus (on salary + performance bonus)
Festival bonus = 62,500 × 0.10 = ₹6,250
Gross income = 62,500 + 6,250 = ₹68,750

Step 3: Insurance (on gross)
Insurance = 68,750 × 0.02 = ₹1,375

Step 4: Tax (on gross before insurance)
Tax = 68,750 × 0.20 = ₹13,750

Step 5: Net take-home
Net = 68,750 - 1,375 - 13,750 = ₹53,625

Analysis:
Base salary: ₹50,000
Net received: ₹53,625
Gain: ₹3,625
Effective gain: (3,625/50,000) × 100 = 7.25%

Despite multiple bonuses (25% + 10%) and tax (20%) + insurance (2%),
employee gains 7.25% due to compounding effects of bonuses.
```

## Part 5.2: Population and Growth Problems

### Deep Example 5C: Population Growth

```
Q: City population 10,00,000
   Year 1: 8% growth
   Year 2: 12% growth
   Year 2-3: 5% migration loss
   Year 3: 10% growth
   
   Find: 1) Population after 3 years
         2) Percentage growth per year (CAGR)

Solution:

Step 1: Apply year-by-year multipliers
After Y1: 10,00,000 × 1.08 = 10,80,000
After Y2: 10,80,000 × 1.12 = 12,09,600
After migration: 12,09,600 × 0.95 = 11,49,120
After Y3: 11,49,120 × 1.10 = 12,64,032

Final population: 12,64,032

Step 2: Calculate total growth percentage
Growth% = (12,64,032 - 10,00,000) / 10,00,000 × 100 = 26.4032%

Step 3: Calculate CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
Using multiplier chain: 1.08 × 1.12 × 0.95 × 1.10 = 1.264032
This is for 3 years.
Annual rate = (1.264032)^(1/3) = 1.0814
So CAGR ≈ 8.14% per year

Interpretation:
Total growth 26.4%, but when spread evenly = 8.14% yearly
This accounts for compounding and the migration dip in Year 2-3
```

## Part 5.3: Distribution and Ratio Problems

### Deep Example 5D: Complex Distribution

```
Q: Company profit ₹10,00,000 to be distributed
   Among employees, shareholders, research in ratio 4:3:2
   Plus 5% of profit goes to tax
   
   Then remaining profit distributed
   
   Find: 1) Tax amount
         2) Each category's amount
         3) If 50 employees, how much per employee?

Solution:

Step 1: Calculate tax
Tax = 10,00,000 × 0.05 = ₹50,000
Distributable profit = 10,00,000 - 50,000 = ₹9,50,000

Step 2: Distribute in ratio 4:3:2
Total parts = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9
Per part = 9,50,000 / 9 = ₹1,05,555.56

Employees: 4 × 1,05,555.56 = ₹4,22,222.24
Shareholders: 3 × 1,05,555.56 = ₹3,16,666.67
Research: 2 × 1,05,555.56 = ₹2,11,111.09

Verification: 4,22,222.24 + 3,16,666.67 + 2,11,111.09 = ₹9,50,000 ✓

Step 3: Per employee
Per employee = 4,22,222.24 / 50 = ₹8,444.44

Summary:
Total profit: ₹10,00,000
Tax paid: ₹50,000
Distributed: ₹9,50,000
Employee share (50 people): ₹8,444.44 each
```

## Part 5.4: Advanced Practice Problems

### Problem Set 5: Integration Challenges

```
**Q5.1:** A trader buys goods for ₹10,000. He marks them 50% higher.
         Gives discounts of 20% and then 10%.
         What's his profit percentage?

**Q5.2:** Three bells ring every 6, 8, and 12 minutes.
         At what ratio of their time periods will they ring together?
         (Hint: Use LCM concept with ratios)

**Q5.3:** A recipe serves 4 people using 300g flour.
         For 10 people, how much flour? (ratio approach)

**Q5.4:** Population grows at 5% yearly for 3 years, then shrinks 10%.
         If initial population 50,000, find final. (successive%)

**Q5.5:** Two items: profit on A is 20%, on B is 30%.
         If costs are ₹500 and ₹800 respectively.
         Total profit% = ? (weighted average)

**Q5.6:** Income A:B:C = 2:3:4
         If total income ₹27,000, and A's income increases by 10%,
         What's A's new income? (ratio + percentage)

**Q5.7:** Item marked ₹1,000, successive discounts 30%, 20%, 10%.
         Final price = ? (successive discount formula)

**Q5.8:** 15 workers complete job in 20 days.
         If 5 quit and 3 join, total workers = 13.
         How many days to complete? (inverse proportion)
```

## Part 5.5: Comprehensive Interview Questions 

### Set 1: Percentage Problems

**Q1: Two-Discount Trap**
```
A store offers 25% discount. Loyalty members get additional 15% discount.
What's the net discount?

Solution:
Let price = ₹100
After 25%: 100 × 0.75 = ₹75
After 15%: 75 × 0.85 = ₹63.75
Net discount = (100 - 63.75) / 100 × 100 = 36.25%

Formula: 25 + 15 - (25 × 15 / 100) = 40 - 3.75 = 36.25% ✓

Interview tip: Explain why it's not 40%. Show the multiplier method.
```

---

**Q2: Salary Paradox**
```
Company gives 15% raise but increases tax from 10% to 25%.
Employee better or worse off?

Original salary: ₹100,000, net after 10% tax: ₹90,000
After raise: ₹115,000, after 25% tax: ₹115,000 × 0.75 = ₹86,250

Net change: (86,250 - 90,000) / 90,000 × 100 = -4.17%

Despite 15% raise, employee is 4.17% worse off!
The extra tax (15 percentage points) hurts more than raise (15%).

Interview tip: Calculate step-by-step, show the impact of different bases.
```

---

### Set 2: Ratio & Proportion

**Q3: Compound Ratio**
```
Boys:Girls = 5:7
Girls:Teachers = 4:1

Find Boys:Girls:Teachers

Solution:
Girls: 7 and 4, LCM = 28
Boys:Girls = 5:7 → multiply by 4 → 20:28
Girls:Teachers = 4:1 → multiply by 7 → 28:7
Result: Boys:Girls:Teachers = 20:28:7

Interview tip: Show the LCM method clearly.
```

---

**Q4: Work Distribution**
```
A work is divided in ratio 3:2:5 among three contractors.
If the profit is ₹50,000 and they split it in same ratio,
How much does each get?

Solution:
Total parts = 3 + 2 + 5 = 10
Contractor 1: (3/10) × 50,000 = ₹15,000
Contractor 2: (2/10) × 50,000 = ₹10,000
Contractor 3: (5/10) × 50,000 = ₹25,000

Interview tip: Show how ratio and percentage are connected.
```

---

### Set 3: Integrated Problems

**Q5: Business Scenario**
```
Manufacturer's cost: ₹400
Marked price: ₹800
Retailer discount: 20%
What's retailer's profit if they sell at marked price to customer?

Solution:
Retailer buys at: 800 × 0.80 = ₹640
Retailer sells at: ₹800
Retailer profit: 800 - 640 = ₹160
Profit%: (160/640) × 100 = 25%

Interview tip: Identify who gets what profit. Show the supply chain.
```

## Part 5.6: Common Interview Traps

### Trap 1: Base Confusion
```
"30% of what?"
Always clarify - percentage of original, final, or something else.
```

---

### Trap 2: Adding Percentages
```
"+20% then +30% is NOT +50%"
Explain the compounding effect.
```

---

### Trap 3: Percentage Point vs Percentage
```
"Interest rate 5% to 6%"
Is it 1 percentage point or 20% increase?
Know both terminologies.
```
