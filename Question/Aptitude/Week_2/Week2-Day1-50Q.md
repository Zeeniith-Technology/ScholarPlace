## TYPE 1: PERCENTAGE FUNDAMENTALS (Q1-Q5)

**Q1** What does percentage fundamentally represent?
- A) A number divided by 100
- B) A ratio with 100 as the denominator (standardized comparison)
- C) The base of all mathematical calculations
- D) Both A and B correct

**Answer:** D  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Explanation:** Percentage = Part/Whole × 100. The "100" standardizes the scale for easy comparison across different-sized groups.

---

**Q2** School A: 15 passed out of 30. School B: 20 passed out of 50. Which performed better?
- A) School B (more absolute passes: 20 > 15)
- B) School A (higher percentage: 50% > 40%)
- C) Equal performance
- D) Cannot compare without more data

**Answer:** B  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Explanation:** Pass rate A = 15/30 × 100 = 50%. Pass rate B = 20/50 × 100 = 40%. A is better despite fewer raw passes. Shows why BASE matters in percentages.

---

**Q3** If 25 out of 80 students passed an exam, what percentage passed?
- A) 25/80 = 0.3125 (incorrect, missing ×100)
- B) 25/80 × 100 = 31.25%
- C) Both A and B show the same answer (just different forms)
- D) Cannot determine without knowing total marks

**Answer:** B  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Explanation:** Always multiply by 100 to convert to percentage. Part = 25, Whole (base) = 80.

---

**Q4** CRITICAL INSIGHT: What is the "base" in a percentage problem?
- A) Always 100 (the denominator)
- B) The reference point we compare against (the whole/total)
- C) Both A and B describe the same concept
- D) The percentage itself

**Answer:** C  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Explanation:** Base = Whole. It's YOUR REFERENCE POINT. Different base = completely different percentage, even if raw numbers are same.

---

**Q5** 30% of X equals 45. Find X
- A) 30% × X = 45
- B) 0.30 × X = 45
- C) X = 45/0.30 = 150
- D) All above equivalent

**Answer:** D  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Explanation:** Rearranging percentage formula: Part = Percentage × Whole → Whole = Part / Percentage.

---

## TYPE 2: PERCENTAGE CHANGE - INCREASES (Q6-Q10)

**Q6** Price increases from 500 to 600. What's the percentage increase?
- A) Change = 600 - 500 = 100
- B) Percentage change = 100/500 × 100 = 20%

**Difficulty:** Expert  
**Explanation:** Successive increases compound. Multiplier = 1.30 × 1.25 × 1.10 = 1.7875.

---

**Q10** Real scenario: Cost price 300, marked 50% above cost. Selling price?
- A) Marked price = 300 × 1.50 = 450
- B) Selling = marked price (if no discount)
- C) Both A and B
- D) Profit = 450 - 300 = 150 (50% profit)

**Answer:** D  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Explanation:** Shows markup concept (percentage above cost price).

---

## TYPE 3: PERCENTAGE CHANGE - DECREASES (Q11-Q15)

**Q11** Price decreases from 1000 to 800. What's the percentage decrease?
- A) Change = 1000 - 800 = 200
- B) Percentage = 200/1000 × 100 = 20%

- B) After 20%: 70 × 0.80 = 56
- C) Final = 56% of original (44% total decrease, not 50%)
- D) All above

**Answer:** D  
**Difficulty:** Hard  
**Explanation:** Successive decreases compound: 0.70 × 0.80 = 0.56. Final 56% (not 100 - 30 - 20 = 50%).

---

**Q14** CRITICAL: If price increases 20%, then DECREASES 20%, do you end up where you started?
- A) Yes, symmetric changes
- B) NO! Increase 20% on 100 = 120. Decrease 20% on 120 = 96 (not 100)
- C) Net loss = 4% even though changes are symmetric
- D) Both B and C correct

**Answer:** D  
**Difficulty:** Expert  
**Explanation:** ASYMMETRY. 20% of 100 = 20. But -20% of 120 = 24. The decrease is larger. This is critical for interviews.

---

**Q15** INTERVIEW: Price increases X%, then decreases X%. Net change formula?
- A) Net multiplier = (1 + X/100) × (1 - X/100)
- B) = 1 - (X/100)² (algebraic expansion)
