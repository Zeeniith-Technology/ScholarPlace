## TYPE 5-6: COMMON MISTAKES & INTERVIEW TIPS (Q61-Q75)

**Q61** ERROR: Splitting profit equally among partners

## TYPE 7-10: COMPLEX SCENARIOS & MASTERY (Q66-Q80)

**Q66-Q75:** Complex scenarios combining wage, efficiency, phases

**Q66** Multi-factor: Profit 20K, A does 60% work at 1.2x efficiency, B does 40% at normal. Fair split?
- **Answer:** Work done 60% vs 40% → A 12K, B 8K (efficiency affects output, not wage base)

**Q67** Partnership dissolution: A invested 80K early (4 months), B invested 100K late (8 months). Profit 36K. Fair split?
- **Answer:** Capital × time: A = 320 units, B = 800 units. A gets ≈8.7K, B gets ≈27.3K

**Q68** Efficiency negotiations: A asks for raise from normal rate. Cost justification?
- **Answer:** If 1.5× efficiency, can do 2/3 of job in same time, justifies higher daily rate

**Q69** Wage allocation across joint and individual work phases?
- **Answer:** Allocate joint work proportional to rates, individual work separately

**Q70** MASTERY: Given vague partnership scenario, what clarifications needed?
- **Answer:** Total work/budget, capital vs labor split, efficiency variations, duration clarity

**Q71-Q80:** Interview prep and synthesis questions

**Q76** "How would you handle a partner dispute over fair wage?"
- **Answer:** Transparent calculation using agreed metrics (work done, rates, time)

**Q77** "What if one partner works more hours but lower efficiency?"
- **Answer:** Wage based on work output (rate × time), not hours alone

**Q78** "Cost optimization: hire external consultant or use existing team at overtime?"
- **Answer:** Compare consultant cost vs. overtime premium + retention costs

**Q79** Real scenario: Project scaled 30% larger mid-way. Wage renegotiation fairness?
- **Answer:** Additional work = additional budget, fair allocation by new work metrics

**Q80** EXPERT: Design a wage system fair for mixed contributions (capital + labor)?
- **Answer:** Weighted model: (Capital% × Profit) + (Labor% × Revenue cost)
