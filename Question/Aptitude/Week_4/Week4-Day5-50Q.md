## TYPE 1-2: INTEGRATION SCENARIOS (Q161-Q180)

**Q161** Complex project: 10w × 25d total = 250 wd. Water system: inlet 1/8/hr, drain 1/12/hr. Can water support?
- A) Worker timeline = 25 days
- B) Water net = 1/8 - 1/12 = 1/24/hr fills 1 tank/day
- C) If 1 tank/day sufficient for crew, YES
- D) All above | **Answer:** D | **Difficulty:** Hard

**Q162** Phase project: Workers change (10w → 15w → 8w). Pipes must scale. Design?
- **Answer:** Larger pipes needed for 15w phase, scale down or use regulators | **Difficulty:** Expert

**Q163** Wage + efficiency + pipes: Phase 1 (5w, 6d), Phase 2 (10w, 8d), both at 1.2x efficiency. Water 1/6/hr, demand 1/8/hr. Budget 36K, wage fairness?
- **Answer:** Calculate wd, then wage per wd, allocate fairly | **Difficulty:** Expert

**Q164** Failure scenario: Worker productivity drops 20% AND pipe pressure drops (rate 1.5x slower). Combined impact?
- **Answer:** Worker effect → longer time, pipe effect → insufficient water. Compounding delays | **Difficulty:** Expert

**Q165** MASTERY: Vague scenario "project delayed." Identify all possible root causes (workers, efficiency, pipes, wages)?
- **Answer:** Systematic approach: Identify constraints, quantify impact, recommend mitigation | **Difficulty:** Expert

## TYPE 3-5: REAL-WORLD BUSINESS INTEGRATION (Q166-Q190)

**Q166** Startup launch: 5 founders, capital $500K, labor sweat equity. Phase 1 (build): 6 months. Phase 2 (launch): 3 months. Profit $100K year 1. Fair wage distribution?
- **Answer:** Capital vs labor split, need explicit model | **Difficulty:** Expert

**Q167** Construction delays: Weather (5-day loss), worker illness (2 people leave), pipe failure (3-day water stop). Cumulative impact?
- **Answer:** Additive? Multiplicative? Order-dependent? Clarify and calculate | **Difficulty:** Expert

**Q168** Cost optimization: Hire 5 more workers (cost $50K wage) vs. buy better equipment (cost $80K). Which saves more time/money?
- **Answer:** NPV analysis, payback period, risk assessment | **Difficulty:** Expert

**Q169** Interview: "Tell me about a time you managed a complex project with variable constraints."
- **Answer:** Use STARCR: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Challenge, Resolution | **Difficulty:** Expert

**Q170** ADVANCED: Design a project management system handling workers, efficiency, pipes, wages simultaneously.
- **Answer:** Framework: Track wd, phase rates, daily rates, allocate costs, monitor schedule | **Difficulty:** Master

## TYPE 6-10: EXPERT MASTERY & SYNTHESIS (Q171-Q250)

**Q171-Q190:** Complex multi-factor scenarios requiring 2-3 concept integration

**Q171** Project 300 wd. Day 15: lose 3w, gain 5w. Day 20: efficiency boost 1.3x. Day 25: pipe leak (rate -1/30/hr demand). Total time, delays, cost implications?

**Q172** Partnership equity split. A (capital 60%, labor 40%), B (capital 40%, labor 60%). Profit $50K. Fair division?

**Q173** Wage negotiation: Worker asks 25% raise. Justification: "I'm 25% more efficient." Employer response?

**Q174** Contingency planning: 20% margin on timeline, 10% on budget. Project 300 wd, $30K. Allocate buffers.

**Q175** Resource contention: Same workers needed for Project A (20 days) AND Project B (15 days), starting same day. Sequencing vs. parallel?

---

**Q176-Q190:** Interview mastery questions

**Q176** "Describe your problem-solving process for an ambiguous scenario."

**Q177** "How would you explain worker-days to a non-technical manager?"

**Q178** "Give an example of when simple linear assumptions break down in reality."

**Q179** "What questions would you ask before quoting a project timeline?"

**Q180** "Design a fair wage system for mixed-contribution partnerships."

---

**Q181-Q200:** Verification & Synthesis

**Q181** Verify: 15 workers, 20 days = 300 wd. Phase 1 (10d, 150 wd). Phase 2 (12w, 10d, 120 wd). Completion check?

**Q182** Efficiency impact: Original 1/10/day. Boost 1.5×. Time savings?

**Q183** Wage accountability: A 60% work, B 40%. Split $10K. A=$6K, B=$4K. Fair?

**Q184** Pipe scenario: Two inlets (1/8, 1/12), drain (1/10). Fill time?

**Q185** Multi-phase with all factors: Calculate time, cost, fairness, risk?

---

**Q186-Q200:** Final synthesis & interview prep

**Q186** Integration: Why does cost not scale linearly with time reduction?

**Q187** Real scenario: Client asks for 50% faster. How to respond? (Options: hire more, efficiency, scope change, timeline stretch)

**Q188** Ethical: Should management push workers to unsustainable efficiency gains?

**Q189** Strategic: When should you invest in tools/training vs. hiring more workers?

**Q190-Q200:** Open-ended mastery questions

**Q191** ULTIMATE MASTERY: Design complete project framework handling all Week 4 concepts.
