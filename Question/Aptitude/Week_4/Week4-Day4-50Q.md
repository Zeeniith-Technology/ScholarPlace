## TYPE 1-3: ADVANCED PIPES SCENARIOS (Q141-Q165)

**Q141** Leak develops mid-filling: Inlet 1/10/hr. After 3 hours (3/10 tank), leak 1/15/hr opens. Time to fill?
- A) Phase 1: 3 hours at 1/10, fill 3/10 tank
- B) Remaining: 7/10 tank
- C) Phase 2 rate: 1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30
- D) Time: (7/10) / (1/30) = 21 hours, Total = 24 hours | **Answer:** D | **Difficulty:** Hard

**Q142** Alternate pipes: A fills 1/8/hr (works 4 hrs), B fills 1/10/hr (works 5 hrs), repeat. When full?
- A) Per cycle: 4/8 + 5/10 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 tank (exactly fills in one cycle!)
- B) Time = 9 hours per cycle, so fills in 9 hours
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Hard

**Q143** Multiple drains problem: Tank has inlet 1/6/hr, outlet 1 (1/10), outlet 2 (1/15). Net?
- A) Net = 1/6 - 1/10 - 1/15 = 10/60 - 6/60 - 4/60 = 0
- B) Tank fills at ZERO rate, never fills!
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Hard

**Q144** Cistern with pump failure: Inlet 1/8, outlet 1/12, pump (adds 1/20). All work together. Real rate?
- A) Net = 1/8 + 1/20 - 1/12 = 15/120 + 6/120 - 10/120 = 11/120
- B) Time = 120/11 ≈ 10.9 hours
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Hard

**Q145** INTERVIEW: Real pool scenario. Two fill pipes (different rates), one drain (constant), one seasonal leak. Variables?
- A) Total 4+ flow rates
- B) Sequence matters (when drain opens, when leak appears)
- C) Need to clarify all timing
- D) All above | **Answer:** D | **Difficulty:** Expert

## TYPE 4-5: CAPACITY-LIMITED & PRACTICAL (Q146-Q165)

**Q146** Pipeline capacity bottleneck: Inlet 1/5/hr, but pipe limits to 1/8/hr. Actual fill rate?
- A) Limited by pipe capacity 1/8/hr
- B) Time = 8 hours (ignoring inlet's potential)
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Hard

**Q147** Tank overflow prevention: Inlet 1/6/hr, max capacity 100L, minimum drain 1/10/hr (safety). Design problem?
- A) Net = 1/6 - 1/10 = 1/15/hr
- B) Still fills positive (safe to design)
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Hard

**Q148** Maintenance downtime: Normally fills 8 hours. Maintenance hour 4, pipe stops 30 min. New time?
- A) Phase 1: 4 hours at 1/8 = 1/2 tank
- B) Remaining: 1/2 tank
- C) Phase 2: 0.5 hours stopped, then resume = (1/2) / (1/8) = 4 hours more
- D) Total = 8.5 hours (extra 0.5 from downtime) | **Answer:** D | **Difficulty:** Medium

**Q149** Weather-dependent: Inlet 1/6 (constant), seasonal evaporation 1/20 (summer only). Fill time varies summer vs. winter?
- A) Winter: 1/6 = 6 hours
- B) Summer: 1/6 - 1/20 = 7/60 = 60/7 ≈ 8.57 hours
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Hard

**Q150** INTERVIEW: Design resilience. If one pipe fails mid-operation, what's contingency?
- A) Must identify critical pipes vs. redundant
- B) Single points of failure risk
- C) Design with buffer capacity
- D) All above | **Answer:** D | **Difficulty:** Expert

## TYPE 6-7: INTEGRATION WITH TIMEWORK (Q151-Q165)

**Q151** Crew + water system: 10 workers complete in 20 days need water support. Two fill pipes: 1/12 & 1/15/hr, drain 1/20/hr. Can support 24-day project if needs 1 tank/day?
- A) Water net rate = 1/12 + 1/15 - 1/20 = 5/60 + 4/60 - 3/60 = 1/15/hr
- B) Fills tank (needed 1/day = 1/24/hr demand)
- C) Yes, water system sufficient | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Hard

**Q152** Phased project with changing water demand: Phase 1 (5d, low demand), Phase 2 (10d, high demand). Design pipe capacity?
- **Answer:** Size pipes for Phase 2 peak demand, oversized for Phase 1 (inefficient) or use pump switches | **Difficulty:** Expert

**Q153-Q165:** Integration scenarios combining workers, efficiency, pipes, wagess
