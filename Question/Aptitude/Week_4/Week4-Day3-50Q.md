- D) All above | **Answer:** D | **Difficulty:** Medium

**Q100** INTERVIEW: Four pipes. If 3 fill in 6 hours, and 4th is drain (empties in 8 hours), combined time?
- A) Three inlets combined: unclear individual rates
- B) Assuming equal inlets: each 1/18, combined 3/18 = 1/6
- C) With drain 1/8: net = 1/6 - 1/8 = 1/24 per hour
- D) Time = 24 hours (must clarify individual pipe info) | **Answer:** D | **Difficulty:** Expert

## TYPE 2: DRAIN & LEAK (NEGATIVE RATE) (Q101-Q110)

**Q101** Pipe A fills 1/6 tank/hour. Drain empties 1/10 tank/hour. Both open. Net?
- A) Net = 1/6 - 1/10 = 1/15 per hour
- B) Time to fill = 15 hours
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Easy

**Q102** Inlet 1/8, outlet 1/12. Net?
- A) Net = 1/8 - 1/12 = 1/24
- B) Fills in 24 hours
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Easy

**Q103** Inlet 1/20, leak 1/30. Tank initially empty. Time to fill?
- A) Net = 1/20 - 1/30 = 1/60 per hour
- B) Time = 60 hours
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Easy

**Q104** Two inlets (1/6, 1/9) and drain 1/10. Combined?
- A) Inlets = 1/6 + 1/9 = 5/18
- B) Net = 5/18 - 1/10 = 16/90 = 8/45
- C) Time = 45/8 = 5.625 hours
- D) All above | **Answer:** D | **Difficulty:** Medium

**Q105** Drain faster than inlet: Fill 1/12, drain 1/8. What happens?
- A) Net = 1/12 - 1/8 = -1/24 (negative)
- B) Tank EMPTIES, not fills
- C) Both A and B | **Answer:** C | **Difficulty:** Medium

**Q106** Cistern: inlet 1/10, outlet (permanent) 1/20. Fill time?

## TYPE 3-5: COMPLEX PIPE SCENARIOS (Q111-Q140)

**Q111-Q130:** Combination problems, partial filling, alternate pipes

**Q111** Pipe A fills 1/8, B fills 1/12. A open 2 hours, then B joins. Time for B to fill remaining?
- **Answer:** A does 2/8 = 1/4, remaining 3/4. AB rate = 5/24, time = 18/5 = 3.6 hours total

**Q112** Three pipes alternate: A (1/6/hr) 2 hours, B (1/8/hr) 3 hours, repeat. When full?
- **Answer:** Per cycle: 2/6 + 3/8 = 13/24 tank. Cycles needed 24/13 ≈ 1.85, total time ≈ 9.23 hours

**Q113** Cistern with continuous drain. Inlet A fills 10 hours (no drain), outlet 15 hours. Real time?
- **Answer:** Net = 1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30, time = 30 hours

**Q114** Two fill pipes and two drains all open. Rate calculations?
- **Answer:** Net = (1/pipe1 + 1/pipe2) - (1/drain1 + 1/drain2)

**Q115-Q140:** Interview prep, real scenarios
