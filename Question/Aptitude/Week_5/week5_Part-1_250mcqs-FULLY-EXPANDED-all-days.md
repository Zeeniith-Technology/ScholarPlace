# 🔵 DAY 1: TIME-SPEED-DISTANCE FUNDAMENTALS - 50 QUESTIONS

**Q1-Q10: Type 1 - Speed as Rate Foundation**

**Q1** Speed fundamentally a RATE like work rate from Week 4?
- A) Both measure output per unit time | B) Distance to speed as work to work rate
- C) Both follow D=S×T or W=R×T | D) All above
- **Answer: D | Hard** | Speed=distance/time, Rate=work/time. Mathematical parallel transfers all Week 4 insights.

**Q2** For fixed distance D, which TRUE?
- A) Speed and time directly proportional | B) Speed and time inversely proportional
- C) Time = Distance/Speed | D) B and C same
- **Answer: D | Easy** | T = D/S. If distance fixed, speed ↑ → time ↓ (inverse). Speed doubles → time halves.

**Q3** Car A 150 km in 3h. Car B 200 km in 4h. Which FASTER?
- A) Car A (50 kmh) | B) Car B (50 kmh) | C) Same speed (50 kmh) | D) Cannot determine
- **Answer: C | Easy** | Both 150/3 = 50 kmh and 200/4 = 50 kmh. Speed=D/T standardizes comparison.

**Q4** 90 kmh to m/s equals:
- A) 90 × 3.6 = 324 m/s | B) 90 × 5/18 = 25 m/s | C) 90 / 18 = 5 m/s | D) Cannot convert
- **Answer: B | Medium** | kmh → m/s: × 5/18. Why? 1km/h = 1000m/3600s = 5/18 m/s. Check: 90 × 5/18 = 25 m/s ✓

**Q5** 15 m/s to kmh equals:
- A) 15 / 3.6 = 4.17 kmh | B) 15 × 3.6 = 54 kmh | C) 15 × 18/5 = 54 kmh | D) B and C equivalent
- **Answer: D | Easy** | m/s → kmh: × 3.6 or × 18/5. Both 54 kmh. Reverse: 54 × 5/18 = 15 m/s ✓

**Q6** Runner 400m in 50s. Speed m/s and kmh?
- A) 8 m/s = 28.8 kmh | B) Both conversions equivalent | C) Only A correct | D) Cannot determine
- **Answer: B | Medium** | 400/50 = 8 m/s. Convert: 8 × 3.6 = 28.8 kmh. Both same speed in different units.

**Q7** Truck 360 km at 80 kmh average. Time in hours:minutes?
- A) 360/80 = 4.5 hours | B) 4.5 = 4h 30min | C) A and B same | D) Cannot determine
- **Answer: C | Medium** | Time = D/S = 360/80 = 4.5h = 4h 30min. Hours:minutes conversion shown.

**Q8** Speed 54 kmh. Distance in 10 seconds?
- A) 54 × 10 = 540 m (wrong units) | B) 54 kmh = 15 m/s; 15 × 10 = 150 m | C) B correct | D) Cannot determine
- **Answer: C | Medium** | Convert first: 54 × 5/18 = 15 m/s. Distance: 15 × 10 = 150 m. Unit conversion critical.

**Q9** LOGIC: Two vehicles same direction, same speed. Distance changes?
- A) Yes, by speed×time | B) No, gap constant | C) Only if one accelerates | D) Depends on distance
- **Answer: B | Medium** | Relative speed = 0 if speeds equal. Gap doesn't change. If 50 km apart, remains 50 km.

**Q10** INTERVIEW: "Why is average speed NOT simple average of segment speeds?"
- A) Speeds at different times | B) Times in segments differ; speed TIME-WEIGHTED
- C) Distances unequal | D) All contribute
- **Answer: B | Expert** | Even equal distances, if times differ (from different speeds), average pulled toward slower speeds dominating time.

**Q27** Two cyclists same direction: A 25 kmh is 50 m ahead of B 20 kmh. After what distance does B catch A?
- A) Time for B to catch: 50m / (20-25) (wrong) | B) Time = 50/(25-20) = 10 seconds
- C) Distance B travels: 20 × 10 = 200m but A also moves: 25 × 10 = 250m (B doesn't catch) WAIT
- D) A is AHEAD and FASTER, so B never catches. B is slower so falls further behind.
- **Answer: D | Hard** | A at 25 kmh is ahead and faster than B at 20 kmh. B can never catch A. Relative speed is NEGATIVE for B (falling behind).

**Q28** Two cars: A 100 kmh behind B 80 kmh. Initially A is 200 km behind. When do they meet?

- A) S₁ + S₂ (wrong) | B) S₁ - S₂ for chasing | C) Depends on who's faster | D) B and C
- **Answer: D | Medium** | Relative = |S₁ - S₂|. Gap closes at rate of speed difference. Faster object closing gap.

**Q30** INTERVIEW: "In same-direction motion, why is relative speed the difference, not sum?"
- A) Only one object reduces gap (the faster one) | B) Sum applies only for opposite directions
- C) Difference is net rate of gap closure | D) All above
- **Answer: D | Expert** | Same direction: only faster object reduces gap. Relative speed = difference. Opposite: both reduce gap, speeds add.

**Q119** Train 90 m at 72 kmh passes another train 60 m at 54 kmh (same direction). Time to completely pass?
- A) Total 150 m = 0.15 km | B) Relative speed = 18 kmh = 5 m/s | C) Time = 150/5 = 30 seconds | D) All correct
- **Answer: D | Hard** | 72 kmh = 20 m/s, 54 kmh = 15 m/s. Relative = 5 m/s. Time = 30s.

**Q120** INTERVIEW: "Why when two trains pass each other, do we add their lengths but for single train passing, we use train length only?"
- A) Passing is relative to the other object | B) Train-to-train: both objects move, so count both lengths
- C) Train-to-platform: platform doesn't move, so count only train length | D) All above
- **Answer: D | Expert** | Passing distance depends on what's passing: train-to-train = sum of lengths, train-to-object = train length only.

- **Answer: D | Medium** | Train + platform = 500 m.

**Q127** Two trains same speed 60 kmh = 16.67 m/s, lengths 100 m and 80 m. Relative speed?
- A) Same direction: 0 (they maintain distance) | B) Opposite: 33.34 m/s (add speeds) | C) Depends on direction | D) All possible
- **Answer: D | Hard** | Same direction: relative = 0, gap constant. Opposite: relative = speeds add.

**Q128** LOGIC: Does train platform length matter when calculating passing time?
- A) Yes, add to train length | B) No, platform doesn't move | C) Yes, it's distance train must cover | D) A and C same
- **Answer: D | Medium** | Platform length matters because train must travel it = train length + platform length.

**Q129** Train A 100 m at 80 kmh catches Train B 50 m at 40 kmh (same track, A behind). Time to completely overtake?
- A) Total distance A travels relative to B = 150 m (both lengths) | B) Relative speed = 40 kmh = 11.11 m/s
- C) Time = 150 / 11.11 ≈ 13.5 seconds | D) All correct
- **Answer: D | Hard** | A must gain 150 m relative to B at 11.11 m/s = 13.5s.

**Q130** INTERVIEW: "Why is passing distance different for train-to-platform vs. train-to-train?"
- A) Platform is stationary; other train moves | B) Moving object changes relative distance | C) Both objects' lengths matter for train-to-train only | D) All above
- **Answer: D | Expert** | Train-to-platform: train covers train+platform. Train-to-train: relative motion, both lengths matter. Conceptual depth.

**Q131-Q140: Type 5 - Meeting & Complex Train Scenarios**

**Q131** Two trains approach on same track: A 90 kmh, B 70 kmh. Initially 800 m apart. When do they meet?
- A) Combined speed = 160 kmh = 44.44 m/s | B) Time = 800 / 44.44 ≈ 18 seconds | C) Both correct | D) Cannot determine
- **Answer: C | Medium** | Opposite directions: speeds add. 800 m / 44.44 m/s ≈ 18s.

**Q132** Three trains on same track: A 80 kmh behind B 60 kmh behind C 40 kmh (all same direction). Initially A is 50 km behind B, B is 30 km behind C. When does A catch B?
- A) Time for A to catch B: 50 / (80-60) = 2.5 hours | B) 2.5 hours before considering C | C) A and B correct | D) Cannot determine

- **Answer: D | Hard** | A covers 42.9% of distance, B covers 57.1%. Meeting point 171.4 km from A's start.

**Q134** Train A passes Train B which passes Train C (all same direction). A > B > C in speed. Initially A is 100 km behind B, B is 50 km behind C. Time for A to catch C?
- A) Direct: A-C relative speed = S_A - S_C. Gap 150 km.
- B) Time = 150 / (S_A - S_C) | C) Time depends on specific speeds | D) B and C

- **Answer: D | Hard** | Head start advantage requires relative speed calculation for catch-up.

- C) A travels 4 hours total (8 AM + 4h = 12 PM) and covers 240 km | D) All consistent
- **Answer: D | Hard** | Head start creates gap requiring relative speed for catch-up.

- A) Calculate head start distance | B) Use relative speed formula | C) Time = head start distance / relative speed | D) All above
