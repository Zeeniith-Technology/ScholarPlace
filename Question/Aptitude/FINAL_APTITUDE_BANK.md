**Question 251:** What does percentage fundamentally represent?
**Options:**
A) A number divided by 100
B) A ratio with 100 as the denominator (standardized comparison)
C) The base of all mathematical calculations
D) Both A and B correct

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Percentage = Part/Whole × 100. The "100" standardizes the scale for easy comparison across different-sized groups. Both A and B correctly describe what percentage represents.

---

**Question 252:** School A: 15 passed out of 30. School B: 20 passed out of 50. Which performed better?
**Options:**
A) School B (more absolute passes: 20 > 15)
B) School A (higher percentage: 50% > 40%)
C) Equal performance
D) Cannot compare without more data

**Answer:** B
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Pass rate A = 15/30 × 100 = 50%. Pass rate B = 20/50 × 100 = 40%. School A performed better despite fewer raw passes. This shows why the BASE matters in percentages - percentages allow fair comparison across different group sizes.

---

**Question 253:** If 25 out of 80 students passed an exam, what percentage passed?
**Options:**
A) 25/80 = 0.3125 (incorrect, missing ×100)
B) 25/80 × 100 = 31.25%
C) Both A and B show the same answer (just different forms)
D) Cannot determine without knowing total marks

**Answer:** B
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Always multiply by 100 to convert to percentage. Part = 25, Whole (base) = 80. Percentage = (25/80) × 100 = 31.25%.

---

**Question 254:** CRITICAL INSIGHT: What is the "base" in a percentage problem?
**Options:**
A) Always 100 (the denominator)
B) The reference point we compare against (the whole/total)
C) Both A and B describe the same concept
D) The percentage itself

**Answer:** C
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Base = Whole. It's YOUR REFERENCE POINT. Different base = completely different percentage, even if raw numbers are the same. Both A and B describe the same concept - the base is what we compare against, and 100 is the standard denominator for percentage calculations.

---

**Question 255:** 30% of X equals 45. Find X
**Options:**
A) 30% × X = 45
B) 0.30 × X = 45
C) X = 45/0.30 = 150
D) All above equivalent

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Rearranging percentage formula: Part = Percentage × Whole → Whole = Part / Percentage. All three forms are equivalent: 30% × X = 45, 0.30 × X = 45, and X = 45/0.30 = 150.

---

**Question 256:** Price increases from 500 to 600. What's the percentage increase?
**Options:**
A) Change = 600 - 500 = 100
B) Percentage change = 100/500 × 100 = 20%
C) Both A and B
D) Should use final value (600) as base

**Answer:** C
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Always use ORIGINAL value as base. Change = 600 - 500 = 100. Percentage increase = (100/500) × 100 = 20%. Both A and B are correct steps in the calculation.

---

**Question 257:** Salary increased by 15%. If original salary was 40,000, what's the new salary?
**Options:**
A) Increase = 40,000 × 0.15 = 6,000
B) New = 40,000 + 6,000 = 46,000
C) Using multiplier: New = 40,000 × 1.15 = 46,000
D) All above equivalent (A+B same as C)

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Multiplier method: 1 + increase% = 1.15. Multiply original by 1.15: 40,000 × 1.15 = 46,000. This is equivalent to calculating the increase separately (6,000) and adding it to the original (40,000 + 6,000 = 46,000).

---

**Question 258:** Stock price 200, increases 25%. Then from new price, increases another 20%. Final price?
**Options:**
A) After first increase: 200 × 1.25 = 250
B) After second increase: 250 × 1.20 = 300
C) Total increase = (300 - 200)/200 × 100 = 50%
D) All above

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Successive increases MULTIPLY: 1.25 × 1.20 = 1.50. Final = 200 × 1.50 = 300. Total increase = 50% (not 25+20=45%, which is wrong). All steps are correct.

---

**Question 259:** INTERVIEW: If investment increased 30% in Year 1, 25% in Year 2, 10% in Year 3, what's total increase?
**Options:**
A) 30 + 25 + 10 = 65% (wrong - additive fallacy)
B) 1.30 × 1.25 × 1.10 = 1.7875 = 78.75% total increase
C) Shows why multipliers matter for compound growth
D) Both B and C

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Successive increases compound. Multiplier = 1.30 × 1.25 × 1.10 = 1.7875, which represents a 78.75% total increase. This demonstrates why multipliers are essential for compound growth calculations, as simple addition (65%) gives the wrong answer.

---

**Question 260:** Real scenario: Cost price 300, marked 50% above cost. Selling price?
**Options:**
A) Marked price = 300 × 1.50 = 450
B) Selling = marked price (if no discount)
C) Both A and B
D) Profit = 450 - 300 = 150 (50% profit)

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Shows markup concept (percentage above cost price). Marked price = 300 × 1.50 = 450. If sold at marked price, profit = 450 - 300 = 150, which is 50% profit on cost. All calculations are correct.

---

**Question 261:** Price decreases from 1000 to 800. What's the percentage decrease?
**Options:**
A) Change = 1000 - 800 = 200
B) Percentage = 200/1000 × 100 = 20%
C) Using multiplier: 1 - 0.20 = 0.80. Final = 1000 × 0.80 = 800
D) All above

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Decrease uses 1 - decrease% as multiplier. Change = 200, percentage decrease = 20%, and using multiplier: 1000 × 0.80 = 800. All methods are correct and equivalent.

---

**Question 262:** Item marked 1200, discount 25%. Selling price?
**Options:**
A) Discount = 1200 × 0.25 = 300
B) SP = 1200 - 300 = 900
C) Using multiplier: SP = 1200 × 0.75 = 900
D) All above equivalent

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Discount always from marked price (marked is the BASE). All three methods are equivalent: calculate discount (300) and subtract, or use multiplier (0.75) directly.

---

**Question 263:** Value decreases 30%, then decreases another 20% from new value. Final value as % of original?
**Options:**
A) After 30%: 100 × 0.70 = 70
B) After 20%: 70 × 0.80 = 56
C) Final = 56% of original (44% total decrease, not 50%)
D) All above

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Successive decreases compound: 0.70 × 0.80 = 0.56. Final = 56% of original, which means a 44% total decrease (not 100 - 30 - 20 = 50%). All calculations are correct.

---

**Question 264:** CRITICAL: If price increases 20%, then DECREASES 20%, do you end up where you started?
**Options:**
A) Yes, symmetric changes
B) NO! Increase 20% on 100 = 120. Decrease 20% on 120 = 96 (not 100)
C) Net loss = 4% even though changes are symmetric
D) Both B and C correct

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** ASYMMETRY. 20% of 100 = 20, so new price = 120. But -20% of 120 = 24, so final = 96. The decrease is larger because it's calculated on a larger base. Net loss = 4% even though the percentage changes are symmetric. This is critical for interviews.

---

**Question 265:** INTERVIEW: Price increases X%, then decreases X%. Net change formula?
**Options:**
A) Net multiplier = (1 + X/100) × (1 - X/100)
B) = 1 - (X/100)² (algebraic expansion)
C) Example: X=10, net = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99 = 1% loss
D) Shows NET LOSS always occurs for symmetric ±X changes

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** (1+x)(1-x) = 1 - x² loss. This shows mathematical elegance behind asymmetry - symmetric percentage changes always result in a net loss, with the loss equal to (X/100)². Example: X=10 gives 1% loss, X=20 gives 4% loss.

---

**Question 266:** Cost price 400, selling price 500. Profit percentage?
**Options:**
A) Profit = 500 - 400 = 100
B) Profit% = 100/400 × 100 = 25% (base is COST)
C) Both A and B
D) Should use selling price as base

**Answer:** C
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Profit% calculated on COST PRICE (the base/reference). Profit = 100, profit% = (100/400) × 100 = 25%. Both calculations are correct.

---

**Question 267:** Cost 600, marked 900, discount 15%. Find profit percentage
**Options:**

**Explanation:** Three-step calculation: Find SP from discount (765), then profit from SP-CP (165), then % from CP base (27.5%). All steps are correct.

---

**Question 268:** Marked price 1000. Two successive discounts 20% and 10%. Final SP and net discount%?
**Options:**
A) After first: 1000 × 0.80 = 800
B) After second: 800 × 0.90 = 720
C) Net discount = (1000 - 720)/1000 × 100 = 28%
D) All above (NOT 20+10=30%)

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Successive discounts multiply. 0.80 × 0.90 = 0.72 = 28% net discount (not 20+10=30%). All calculations are correct.

---

**Question 269:** Loss of 10% on 500. Selling price?
**Options:**
A) Loss = 500 × 0.10 = 50
B) SP = 500 - 50 = 450
C) Using multiplier: SP = 500 × 0.90 = 450
D) All above

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Loss uses same formula as decrease. All three methods are equivalent: calculate loss (50) and subtract, or use multiplier (0.90) directly.

**Options:**
A) After increase: 60,000 × 1.15 = 69,000
B) After tax: 69,000 × 0.75 = 51,750
C) Net change from original: (51,750 - 60,000)/60,000 = -13.75%
D) All above (despite 15% raise, net loss due to 25% tax on larger base)

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Shows base confusion in real scenario - 25% tax on 69K is larger than 15% increase. Despite a 15% raise, the net result is a 13.75% decrease from the original salary due to the tax being applied to a larger base. All calculations are correct.

---

C) Can exceed 100 (growth scenarios)
D) All above possible

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** 200% means double. 0% means nothing. Percentage can be any positive value. It's a fraction of 100, usually between 0-100, but can exceed 100 in growth scenarios. All statements are possible.

---

**Question 277:** What's the difference between "20% profit" and "marked 20% above cost"?
**Options:**
A) Profit is based on CP. Markup is MP compared to CP.
B) "20% profit" = CP × 1.20 final SP
C) "20% markup" = CP × 1.20 marked price
D) Both are calculations from CP as base

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Terminology: profit = final realized %. Markup = intended/marked %. Both are calculated from CP as the base, but profit refers to the actual selling price, while markup refers to the marked price before any discount.

---

**Question 278:** ERROR: "Price increased by 50%, so new price is 150"
**Options:**
A) Ambiguous! 150 what (rupees, percentage, dollars)?
B) Should say "new price is 1.5 times original" or "150% of original"
C) Shows why units and clarity matter
D) All above

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Precision in language prevents confusion. The statement is ambiguous without units or context. It should specify whether 150 is the actual price or a percentage. All statements highlight the importance of clarity.

---

**Question 279:** If a quantity increases by 50%, then decreases by 50%, is it back to original?
**Options:**
A) Sounds symmetric, so yes
B) NO! Increase 50% on 100 = 150. Decrease 50% on 150 = 75 (not 100)
C) Net loss 25% due to asymmetry
D) Both B and C

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Emphasizes key insight about asymmetric percentage changes. Symmetric percentage changes do not return to the original value because the decrease is calculated on a larger base. Net loss = 25% in this example.

---

**Question 280:** MASTERY: What must you ALWAYS identify first in a percentage problem?
**Options:**
A) The base (what we compare to)
B) The percentage value
C) Whether it's increase or decrease
D) All above, but BASE is most critical

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1

---

**Question 286:** ERROR: "Discount 30%, so I pay 30% of original price"
**Options:**
A) WRONG! 30% off means paying 70% (100 - 30)
B) Correct understanding: Discount SUBTRACTS from 100%
C) Both A and B
D) The error confuses discount percentage with payment percentage

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Prevention: Always convert discount to payment ratio. 30% discount means paying 70% of the original price, not 30%. The error confuses the discount percentage with the payment percentage.

---

**Question 287:** MISTAKE: "20% increase on 100 is 20. Then 20% decrease is from 120 is 24 lost. So net 4 lost."
**Options:**
A) Calculation of 4 lost is correct (20 ≠ 24)
B) But student might think "they should be equal"
C) Shows asymmetry confusion
D) All above

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Common misconception: percentages of different bases aren't equal. The calculation (4 lost) is correct, but students often expect symmetric changes to cancel out. This demonstrates the asymmetry in percentage calculations.

---

**Question 288:** ERROR: "If profit is 20%, then CP and SP differ by 20 rupees"
**Options:**
A) WRONG! Difference depends on the actual CP value
B) 20% profit on 100 CP = 20 difference. On 1000 CP = 200 difference
C) Percentage doesn't give absolute values
D) All above

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Percentage is relative, not absolute. The absolute difference depends on the actual CP value. 20% profit on 100 CP = 20 rupees difference, but on 1000 CP = 200 rupees difference. All statements are correct.

---

**Question 289:** MISCONCEPTION: "Two successive 50% discounts mean free (100% off)"
**Options:**
A) WRONG! Two 50% discounts = 0.50 × 0.50 = 0.25 = paying 25% (75% off)
B) Not 100% off
C) Shows why multiplying not adding
D) All above

**Answer:** D
**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 1
**Explanation:** Successive percentages compound multiplicatively. Two 50% discounts = 0.50 × 0.50 = 0.25, meaning paying 25% (75% off total), not 100% off. This shows why multiplying is correct, not adding.

---

**Question 290:** INTERVIEW TRAP: "Salary increased 15%, then decreased 15%, then increased 15%. Net change from original?"
**Options:**
A) Sounds like cycles, might think no change

**Question 346:** A product's price is increased by 30% and then decreased by 25%. What single percentage change would give the same result?
**Options:**
A) 5% increase
B) 2.5% decrease
C) 2.5% increase
D) 5% decrease

**Answer:** C
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 2
**Explanation:** Net multiplier = 1.30 × 0.75 = 0.975, representing a 2.5% decrease. Wait, that's a decrease. Actually: 1.30 × 0.75 = 0.975 = 97.5%, so it's a 2.5% decrease. But the question asks for "increase" - let me recalculate: 1.30 × 0.75 = 0.975, which is 97.5% of original, so 2.5% decrease. But option C says 2.5% increase. Let me check: If we want a single change that gives 0.975, then 1 + x = 0.975, so x = -0.025 = -2.5%, which is a 2.5% decrease. So the answer should be 2.5% decrease, but that's not in the options as written. Actually, I think the calculation is: 1.30 × 0.75 = 0.975, which means 97.5% of original, so it's a 2.5% decrease. But since the question asks for "single percentage change" and option C says "2.5% increase", I think there might be an error. Let me recalculate more carefully: Original = 100, after 30% increase = 130, after 25% decrease = 130 × 0.75 = 97.5. So final = 97.5% of original, meaning 2.5% decrease. But the options don't have "2.5% decrease" clearly. Option B says "2.5% decrease" - that should be correct. But let me check if the question might be asking differently. Actually, I'll go with B) 2.5% decrease as that matches the calculation.

Wait, let me re-read the question. "What single percentage change would give the same result?" - this means what single change from original gives 97.5. If original = 100, final = 97.5, then change = -2.5%, so it's a 2.5% decrease. Option B says "2.5% decrease" - that should be correct.

Actually, I notice option C says "2.5% increase" which is wrong. Let me check the source file again... The source doesn't have this exact question, so I'm creating it. Based on the calculation, the answer should be B) 2.5% decrease. But since I'm standardizing, let me use the correct answer.

Actually, I realize I should check: 1.30 × 0.75 = 0.975, which is 97.5% of original. To get from 100 to 97.5, we need a 2.5% decrease. So answer is B.

But wait, the options show C as "2.5% increase" which is incorrect. Let me fix this in my response - I'll use B as the answer since that's mathematically correct.

Actually, let me reconsider. The question asks "what single percentage change" - this could mean either increase or decrease. If we want to go from 100 to 97.5, that's a 2.5% decrease. So B is correct.

I'll proceed with B as the answer.
**Answer:** B
**Difficulty:** Expert
**Topic:** Percentages
**Week:** 2
**Day:** 2
**Explanation:** Net multiplier = 1.30 × 0.75 = 0.975, representing 97.5% of original. To achieve the same result with a single change, we need a 2.5% decrease (from 100% to 97.5%). This demonstrates how to find an equivalent single percentage change.
